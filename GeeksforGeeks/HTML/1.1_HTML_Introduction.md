### 1.1. HTML | Introduction
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most of markup (e.g. HTML) languages are human readable. Language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.

HTML is a markup language which is used by the browser to manipulate text, images and other content to display it in required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0 but the first standard version was HTML 2.0 which was published in 1999.

| HTML | 1.0 |	1991 |
| HTML | 2.0	| 1995 |
| HTML | 3.2	| 1997 |
| HTML | 4.01 |	1999 |

`<DOCTYPE! html>`: This tag is used to tells the HTML version. This currently tells that the version is HTML 5.

`<html>`: This is called HTML root element and used to wrap all the code.

`<head>`: Head tag contains metadata, title, page CSS etc. All the HTML elements that can be used inside the <head> element are:

* `<style>`
* `<title>`
* `<base>`
* `<noscript>`
* `<script>`
* `<meta>`
* `<title>`

`<body>`: Body tag is used to enclosed all the data which a web page has from texts to links. All of the content that you see rendered in the browser is contained within this element.

**Example**: HTML page can be created using any text editor (notepad). Then save that file using .htm or .html extension and open that file in browser. It will get the HTML page response.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    <title>demo web page</title>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color:#009900;
            font-size:46px;
        }
        p {
            font-size:17px;
            margin-top:-25px;
            margin-left:15px;
        }
    </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>GeeksforGeek</h1>
