### 1.16. HTML | Doctypes

**What is doctype?**

A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction which tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. The Doctype is not an element or tag, it lets the browser know about the version of or standard of HTML or any other markup language that is being used in the document.

**Declaration of a Doctype**: A DOCTYPE declaration appears at the top of a web page before all other elements. According to the HTML specification or standards, every HTML document requires a document type declaration to ensure that the pages are displayed in the way they are intended to be displayed.

The DOCTYPE for HTML5 is case-insensitive and can be written as shown below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```


**Doctype Usage**: In the version, HTML 4.01, the usage of DOCTYPE declaration was to create a reference to a document type definition (DTD), since the version HTML 4.01 was completely based on a Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML).

The document type definition (DTD) is responsible for specifying the rules for the Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML) so that the browser processes the content correctly. But in the HTML version,HTML 5 there isnt any need of a reference to a document type definition (DTD) because HTML 5 in not based on a Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML).

In HTML 5,the DOCTYPE declaration is only required for enabling the standard mode for writing docments.

Below is a sample HTML program with doctype declaration:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>HTML Doctypes</title>
</head>

<body>
HTML is easy to learn.
</body>

</html>
```
