### 1.5. HTML | Paragraph

#### `<p>` tag

The `<p>` tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tag. So anything mentioned within `<p>` and `</p>` is treated as a paragraph. Most browsers read a line as a paragraph even if we don’t use the closing tag i.e, `</p>`, but this may raise unexpected results. So, it is both a good convention and we must use the closing tag.

**Example**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Paragraph</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>A Computer Science portal for geeks.</p>
    <p>It contains well written, well thought articles.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

When we look at the webpage, we see that there are few spaces added before and after a paragraph. HTML does this by default. Let’s look at few properties of paragraph tag:



* As already mentioned, the `<p>` tag automatically adds space before and after any paragraph, which is basically margins added by the browser.
* If a user adds multiple spaces, the browser reduces them it to a single space.
* If a user adds multiple lines, the browser reduces them to a single line.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Display_Paragraph</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
    This paragraph has multiple
    lines. But HTML reduces them
    to a single line, omitting
    the carriage return we have used.
    </p>

    <p>
    This paragraph      has multiple
    spaces.     But HTML reduces   them
    all to a     single space,   omitting
    the extra   spaces and line    we have used.
    </p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### `<br>` tag

**Break Line tag**: There is a way to let the HTML know where does the browser need to change the lines by the use of `<br>` tag. These tags do not have any closing tag. So, just a single opening tag will change the line.

**Example**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Display_Paragraph</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
    This paragraph has multiple<br>
    lines. But HTML reduces them<br>
    to a single line, omitting<br>
    the carriage return we have used.
    </p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### `<align attribute>`
**align Attribute**: The `<p>` tag specifically supports the alignment attribute and allows us to align our paragraphs in left, right or center alignment.

Syntax:
```html
<p align="value">
```

**Example** :

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Paragraph</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p align="center">Welcome Geeks</p>
    <p align="left">A Computer Science portal for geeks.</p>
    <p align="right">It contains well written, well thought articles.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### The `<pre>` element

We have seen how the paragraph tag ignores all the change of lines and extra spaces within a paragraph, but there is a way to preserve this by the use of `<pre>` tag. It also contains an opening and a closing tag. It displays a text within a fixed height and width and preserves the extra lines and spaces we use.

**Example** :

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Display_Paragraph</title>
</head>
<body>
    <pre>
    This paragraph has multiple
    lines. But it is displayed  
    as it is unlike the paragraph  
    tag.
    </pre>

    <pre>
    This     paragraph has multiple
    spaces. But     it is displayed  
    as it is    unlike the paragraph  
         tag.
    </pre>
</body>
</html>
```
