# W3Schools - HTML5
## 1. HTML Tutorial

You can find the .html worksheet of this study [here](https://github.com/hevalhazalkurt/Learn_Code_Study_Notes/blob/master/W3Schools/HTML5/Notes/1.14_HTML_Links.html).

### 1.14. HTML Links

Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.


#### HTML Links - Hyperlinks

HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

**Note** : A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element.



#### HTML Links - Syntax

In HTML, links are defined with the `<a>` tag:

```html
<a href="url">link text</a>
```

```html
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a></p>
```

***Output***:

The `href` attribute specifies the destination address (https://www.w3schools.com/html/) of the link.

The **link text** is the visible part (Visit our HTML tutorial).

Clicking on the link text will send you to the specified address.

**Note**: Without a forward slash at the end of subfolder addresses, you might generate two requests to the server. Many servers will automatically add a forward slash to the end of the address, and then create a new request.


#### Local Links

The example above used an absolute URL (a full web address).

A local link (link to the same web site) is specified with a relative URL (without https://www....).

```html
<p><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a> is a link to a page on this website.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> is a link to a website on the World Wide Web.</p>
```

#### HTML Link Colors

By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):

* An unvisited link is underlined and blue
* A visited link is underlined and purple
* An active link is underlined and red

You can change the default colors, by using CSS:


```css
a:link {
  color: green;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}
a:visited {
  color: pink;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}
a:hover {
  color: red;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
a:active {
  color: yellow;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

Links are often styled as buttons, by using CSS:

```css
a:link, a:visited {
  background-color: #f44336;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 25px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
}

a:hover, a:active {
  background-color: red;
}
```

#### HTML Links - The target Attribute

The `target` attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The `target` attribute can have one of the following values:

* `_blank` - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
* `_self` - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
* `_parent` - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
* `_top` - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
* `framename` - Opens the linked document in a named frame

This example will open the linked document in a new browser window/tab:


```html
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank">Visit our HTML tutorial!</a>
```

**Tip**: If your webpage is locked in a frame, you can use `target= "_top"` to break out of the frame:

```html
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_top">HTML5 tutorial!</a>
```



#### HTML Links - Image as Link

It is common to use images as links:

```html
<p>This is an image link. You can click on it.</p>
<a href="default.asp"><img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/smiley.gif" style="width: 42px; height: 42px; border: 0px;"></a>
```

***Output***:

**Note**: `border:0;` is added to prevent IE9 (and earlier) from displaying a border around the image (when the image is a link).

#### Link Titles

The `title` attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.

```html
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a></p>
```

#### HTML Links - Create a Bookmark

HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page.

Bookmarks can be useful if your webpage is very long.

To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it.

When the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

**Example**

First, create a bookmark with the `id` attribute:

```html
<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
```

Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:

```html
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
```

Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from another page:

```html
<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
```



#### External Paths

External pages can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.

This example uses a full URL to link to a web page:

```html
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
```

This example links to a page located in the html folder on the current web site:

```html
<a href="/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
```


This example links to a page located in the same folder as the current page:


```html
<a href="default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
```
