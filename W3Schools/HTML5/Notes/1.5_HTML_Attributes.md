# W3Schools - HTML5
## 1. HTML Tutorial

You can find the .html worksheet of this study [here](https://github.com/hevalhazalkurt/Learn_Code_Study_Notes/blob/master/W3Schools/HTML5/Notes/1.5_HTML_Attributes.html).

### 1.5. HTML Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

* All HTML elements can have attributes
* Attributes provide additional information about an element
* Attributes are always specified in the start tag
* Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: `name="value"`

---

#### The href Attribute

HTML links are defined with the `<a>` tag. The link address is specified in the `href` attribute:

```html
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
```

You will learn more about links and the `<a>` tag later in this tutorial.

---

#### The src Attribute

HTML images are defined with the `<img>` tag.

The filename of the image source is specified in the `src` attribute:

```html
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_girl.jpg">
```

#### The width and height Attributes

Images in HTML have a set of size attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image:

```html
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_girl.jpg">
<hr>
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_girl.jpg" width="200" height="250" >
```

***Output***:

The image size is specified in pixels: width="200" means 200 pixels wide.

You will learn more about images in our HTML Images chapter.

---

#### The alt Attribute

The `alt` attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when an image cannot be displayed.

The value of the attribute can be read by screen readers. This way, someone "listening" to the webpage, e.g. a vision impaired person, can "hear" the element.

The alt attribute is also useful if the image does not exist:

```html
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_girl.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="Girl with a jacket">
<img src="" width="200" height="250" alt="Girl with a jacket">
```

#### The style Attribute

The `style` attribute is used to specify the styling of an element, like color, font, size etc.

```html
<p>I am a paragraph.</p>
<p style="color:red">I am a paragraph.</p>
```

***Output***:

You will learn more about styling later in this tutorial, and in our CSS Tutorial.

---

#### The lang Attribute

The language of the document can be declared in the `<html>` tag.

The language is declared with the `lang` attribute.

Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>

...

</body>
</html>
```

The first two letters specify the language (en). If there is a dialect, use two more letters (US).


---

#### The title Attribute

Here, a `title` attribute is added to the `<p>` element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the paragraph:

```html
<h2 title="I'm a header">The title Attribute</h2>
<p title="I'm a tooltip">Mouse over this paragraph, to display the title attribute as a tooltip.</p>
```

#### We Suggest: Use Lowercase Attributes

The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase attribute names.

The title attribute can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.

W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.


---

#### We Suggest: Quote Attribute Values

The HTML5 standard does not require quotes around attribute values.

The `href` attribute, demonstrated above, can be written without quotes:

```html
<!-- Bad Coding -->
<a href=https://www.w3schools.com>This is a link</a>

<!-- Good Coding -->
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
```

W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.

Sometimes it is necessary to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space:


```html
<p title=About W3Schools>
```

Using quotes are the most common. Omitting quotes can produce errors.


---

#### Single or Double Quotes?

Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

```html
<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>John with double quotes</p>
<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">John with single quotes</p>
```


---

### Chapter Summary

* All HTML elements can have attributes
* The `title` attribute provides additional "tool-tip" information
* The `href` attribute provides address information for links
* The `width` and `height` attributes provide size information for images
* The `alt` attribute provides text for screen readers
* At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names
* At W3Schools we always quote attribute values with double quotes

### HTML Exercises

##### Exercise 1 :

Add a "tooltip" to the paragraph below with the text "About W3Schools".

```html
<!-- GIVEN -->
<p ____ ="About W3Schools">W3Schools is a web developer's site.</p>

<!-- SOLUTION -->
<p title ="About W3Schools">W3Schools is a web developer's site.</p>
```

---

##### Exercise 2 :

Set the size of the image to 250 pixels wide and 400 pixels tall.

```html
<!-- GIVEN -->
<img src="w3schools.jpg" width=" " height=" ">

<!-- SOLUTION -->
<img src="w3schools.jpg" width="250" height="400">
```

---

##### Exercise 3 :

Make the element below into a link that goes to "https://www.w3schools.com".

```html
<!-- GIVEN -->
<a _____ "https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

<!-- SOLUTION -->
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
```

---

##### Exercise 4 :

Specify an alternate text for the image.

Alternate text is useful when the image cannot be displayed, like when the page is read by a screen reader.


```html
<!-- GIVEN -->
<img src="w3schools.png" _____="w3schools Logo">

<!-- SOLUTION -->
<img src="w3schools.png" alt="w3schools Logo">
```
