## 1. HTML Tutorial

You can find the .html worksheet of this study [here](https://github.com/hevalhazalkurt/Learn_Code_Study_Notes/blob/master/W3Schools/HTML5/Notes/1.6_HTML_Headings.html).

### 1.6. HTML Headings

Headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.

`<h1>` defines the most important heading. `<h6>` defines the least important heading.

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

**Note**: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.

#### Headings Are Important

Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

`<h1>` headings should be used for main headings, followed by `<h2>` headings, then the less important `<h3>`, and so on.


**Note**: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

#### Bigger Headings

Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the `style` attribute, using the CSS `font-size` property:

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 60px">Heading 1</h1>
<h2 style="font-size: 50px">Heading 2</h2>
<h3 style="font-size: 40px">Heading 3</h3>
<h4 style="font-size: 30px">Heading 4</h4>
<h5 style="font-size: 20px">Heading 5</h5>
<h6 style="font-size: 10px">Heading 6</h6>
```

#### HTML Horizontal Rules

The `<hr>` tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The `<hr>` element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:

```html
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text</p>
<hr>

<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>

<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
```

#### The HTML `<head>` Element

The HTML `<head>` element has nothing to do with HTML headings.

The `<head>` element is a container for metadata. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

The `<head>` element is placed between the `<html>` tag and the `<body>` tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>My First HTML</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>

<body>
.
.
.
```

**Note**: Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.

#### How to View HTML Source?

Have you ever seen a Web page and wondered "Hey! How did they do that?"

**View HTML Source Code:**

Right-click in an HTML page and select "View Page Source" (in Chrome) or "View Source" (in IE), or similar in other browsers. This will open a window containing the HTML source code of the page.

**Inspect an HTML Element:**

Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" to see what elements are made up of (you will see both the HTML and the CSS). You can also edit the HTML or CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens.

### HTML Exercises

##### Exercise 1 :

Use the correct HTML tag to add a heading with the text "London".

```html
<!-- GIVEN -->
<p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>

<!-- SOLUTION -->
<h1>London</h1>
<p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
```

##### Exercise 2 :

Add a horizontal rule between the heading and the paragraph.

```html
<!-- GIVEN -->
<h1>London</h1>
<p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>

<!-- SOLUTION -->
<h1>London</h1>
<hr>
<p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
```


##### Exercise 3 :

Add six headings to the document with the text "Hello".

Start with the most important heading (the largest) and end with the least important heading (the smallest).

```html
<!-- GIVEN -->
<html>
<body>

</body>
</html>


<!-- SOLUTION -->
<html>
<body>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <h2>Hello</h2>
  <h3>Hello</h3>
  <h4>Hello</h4>
  <h5>Hello</h5>
  <h6>Hello</h6>
</body>
</html>
```



##### Exercise 4 :

Mark up the text with appropriate tags:

"Universal Studios Presents" is the most important heading.

"Jurassic Park" is the next most important heading.

"About" is the third most important heading.

The last sentence is just a paragraph.

Start with the most important heading (the largest) and end with the least important heading (the smallest).

```html
<!-- GIVEN -->
Universal Studios Presents
Jurassic Park
About
On the Island of Isla Nublar, a new park has been built: Jurassic Park is a theme park of cloned dinosaurs!!
