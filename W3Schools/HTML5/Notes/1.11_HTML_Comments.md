### 1.11. HTML Comments

Comment tags are used to insert comments in the HTML source code.

You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:

`<!-- Write your comments here -->`

Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the opening tag, but not in the closing tag.

**Note** : Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- Comments are not displayed in the browser -->
```

Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors:


```html
<!-- Do not display this at the moment
<img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
-->
```
