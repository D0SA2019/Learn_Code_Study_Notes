### 1.23. HTML File Paths


| Path | Description |
|--|--|
| `<img src="picture.jpg">` | picture.jpg is located in the same folder as the current page |
| `<img src="images/picture.jpg">` | picture.jpg is located in the images folder in the current folder |
| `<img src="/images/picture.jpg">` | picture.jpg is located in the images folder at the root of the current web |
| `<img src="../picture.jpg">` | picture.jpg is located in the folder one level up from the current folder |


#### HTML File Paths

A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.

File paths are used when linking to external files like:

* Web pages
* Images
* Style sheets
* JavaScripts


-----

#### Absolute File Paths

An absolute file path is the full URL to an internet file:


```html
<h2>Using a Full URL File Path</h2>
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" syle="width:300px">
```

#### Relative File Paths

A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.

In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:


```html
<h2>Using a Relative File Path</h2>
<img src="images/mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain" style="width:300px">
```

#### Best Practice

It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).

When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current base URL. All links will work on your own computer (localhost) as well as on your current public domain and your future public domains.
