# 2. CSS Essential Training 1
***by Christina Truong***


CSS is a stylesheet language that allows you to control the appearance of your webpages. In this hands-on course—the first installment in an ongoing series—Christina Truong demonstrates the concepts that form the foundation of CSS, and explains how to use this language to add colors and other design elements to take your webpages beyond just black text on a white background. Christina covers selecting content, how the box model defines the spacing and sizing of page elements, styling text, and managing basic layouts. She also explores the tools needed to work with CSS, how to use selectors to target elements, and guidelines for page layouts with floats. Plus, at the end of the course, you'll walk away with an actual project—an online résumé page.

Topics include:
* Creating a CSS file
* Writing basic selectors
* Setting properties
* Using different typefaces and web-safe fonts
* Understanding cascading and inheritance
* Setting a font family, font size, text color, and more
* Understanding the box model
