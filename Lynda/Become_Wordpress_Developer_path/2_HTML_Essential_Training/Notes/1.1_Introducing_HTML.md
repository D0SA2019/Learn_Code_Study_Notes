# 2. HTML Essential Training
## 1.1. Introducing HTML

### 1.1.1. The importance of HTML
A new web designer needs at least 3 languages : HTML, CSS and Javascript. These three languages are the basis of all internet development and contents. With CSS, you can control the web page's visual side. With Javascript, you can control the behaviors of the page. However, you need HTML most because HTML is the base of the page's structure.

We can understand a web page's structure, relationships of its contents and links by HTML. Because HTML is a **Markup Language**.

### 1.1.2. Basic HTML syntax
*You can find the exercise file of this part [here]()*

To begin into HTML, you'll need a basic text editor that can handle raw TXT files. It can be different based on your computer systems. Here are some examples:

* Mac -> Text Editor
* Windows -> Notepad
* Alternative -> TextWrangler

Our exercise file consist of these lines so write it on the text editor and open it on your browser.  

```
HTML uses tags to identify page content. This text, for example, is a paragraph.
```

Your browser will look like this :

`<p>content</p>` : It describes the text as paragraph

**element** : A HTML element consists of content, opening and closing tags. Some tags also can have one or more attributes.  

```html
<p>HTML uses tags to identify page content. This text, for example, is a paragraph.</p>
```

`lang="en"` : It defines what the content's language. The `lang` is an attribute, `"en"` is a value.

```html
<p lan="en">HTML uses tags to identify page content. This text, for example, is a paragraph.</p>
```

There are two types of attributes:
* Informative
* Functional

`<h1>content</h1>` : It makes content heading.

```html
<h1>HTML uses tags to identify page content. This text, for example, is a paragraph.</h1>
```
It changes the text as follows :

`<em>content</em>` : It makes content emphasize.

For make more complex structures we can use nested tags. For example :

```html
<p>HTML uses tags to identify page content. <em>This text, for example, is a paragraph. </em></p>
```

It will look like :

There are some rules about nesting elements. You can use nesting for some tags, we can check them out later. Also, a child element's tag can't close after parent element's tag.

```html
<!-- Wrong -->
<p>HTML uses tags to identify page <em>content.</p></em>

<!-- True -->
<p>HTML uses tags to identify page <em>content.</em></p>
```

`<strong>content</strong>` : It makes content bold.

```html
<p>HTML uses tags to identify page content. <em>This text, for example, is a <strong>paragraph.</strong></em></p>
```

Iw will look like :

### 1.1.3. The current state of HTML

The web changes fast and you need to stay current with the standarts that you're gonna be using. Let's look how HTML develops shortly :

* 1991 : Tim Berners-Lee published "HTML Tags"
* 1995 : HTML2.0 - HTML 4.0 are released. Rapid development and uneven adoption of standarts. Browser support became nearly universal. Remains the most stable HTML specification.
* 2000 : W3C releases XHTML 1.0. First step in the eventual move of HTML towards XML.
* 2001 : WHATWG forms to continue work on HTML. Group works to evolve HTML past the 4.0 spec.
* 2007 : W3C creates new HTML5 Working Groups
* 2009 : W3C drops the charter from XHTML 2.0. Move towards XML is abandoned.
* Today : There are currently two specifications of HTML being developed.

A good HTML editor can speed up your process, catch your syntax errors. Try all of them choose the most you like. In the course, [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is using.
