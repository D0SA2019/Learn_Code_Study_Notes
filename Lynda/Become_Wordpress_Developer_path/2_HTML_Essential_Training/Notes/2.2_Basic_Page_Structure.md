### 2.2.1. Exploring an HTML document
We’ll be focusing essentials of an HTML file on this part.

To see any HTML page’s source code you can use the browser’s development tools. On Chrome, just click right and select **Inspect**.

Here is the codes that we practice on it :

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="description" content="A page for exploring basic HTML documents">
  <title>Basic HTML document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Page content</h1>
    <p>The main page content appears inside the <b>body</b> tag. HTML contains several elements that allow you to properly structure and format your content, which we'll cover later.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

It will look on youe browser like :

You can see on the above codes, the basic structure of a HTML consists of 3 parts :

* `<html>`all codes`</html>`
* `<head>`metatags and info's of page`</head>`
* `<body>`contents`</body> `

### 2.2.2. DOCTYPE declarations
Most of the time, developers don’t understand what DOCTYPE declaration is but know they need one. The point of DOCTYPE declaration is telling browser and user agent what version of HTML using on the page. Old versions of HTML has different declaration but for HTML5, we use short and cool code line `<!DOCTYPE HTML>`.

You can check the other declarations here : https://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html

To start developing an HTML page, you need to declaration first.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
```


### 2.2.3. The document head

After the declaration, you need `<html>` tag with a `lang` attribute and a `<head>` tag. The `lang` attribute is useful but not necessary.

* `<meta charset="utf-8">` : Tells the browser which encoding characters using on the page  
* `<meta name="" content=""` : Tells the browser and user agent what is page about
* `<title>`page title`</title>` : Defines the page title.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lan="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="description" content="A page for exploring HTML documents">
    <title>Basic HTML document</title>
  </head>

</html>
```

`<head>` contents aren't visible by user but the title looks on the browser like this :

### 2.2.4. The document body

* `<body>` part is the visible part of the page by user.
* `<h1>`title`</h1>` : top level heading
* `<p>`text`</p>` : defines the text as a paragraph
* `<b>`text`</b>` : makes the text bold

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lan="en">

  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="description" content="A page for exploring HTML documents">
    <title>Basic HTML document</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Page Content</h1>
    <p>The main page content appears inside the <b>body</b> tag. HTML contains several elements that allow you to properly structure and format your content, which we'll cover later.</p>
  </body>

</html>
```

### 2.2.5. Understanding content models

**Content Models** : These define the type of content expected inside an element and control syntax rules such as element nesting. There are basic content types :

* block level contents
* inline contents

Check the example below :

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lan="en">

  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="description" content="A page for exploring HTML content models">
    <title>Content models</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Content models</h1>
    <p>In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements. <b>Block level</b> elements would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while <b>inline level</b> elements typically appear within the flow of text content.</p>
    <p>In this example the <b>heading 1</b> and the <b>paragraphs</b> are block level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline level elements.</p>
    <p>In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML. There are seven main models: <b>Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning</b>. To learn more about them, visit the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#kinds-of-content">interactive graphic</a> contained in the W3C HTML5 specfication.</p>
  </body>

</html>
```

Each element in HTML falls into zero or more categories that group elements with similar characteristics together. These categories are related as follows:
