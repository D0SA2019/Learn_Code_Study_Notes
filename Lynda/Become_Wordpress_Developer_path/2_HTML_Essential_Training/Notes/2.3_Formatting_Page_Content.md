# 2. HTML Essential Training
## 2.3. Formatting Page Content

You can find the worksheet of this study [here](https://github.com/hevalhazalkurt/Learn_Code_Study_Notes/blob/master/Lynda/Become_Wordpress_Developer_path/2_HTML_Essential_Training/Notes/2.3_Formatting_Page_Content.html).

### 2.3.1. Formatting content with HTML

* `<pre>`text`</pre>` : Defines preformatted text
* `<h1>`text`</h1>` : Makes text heading
* `<p>`text`</p>` : Defines text as a paragraph
* `<i>`text`</i>` : Makes the text italic
* `<b>`text`</b>` : Makes the text bold
* `<em>`text`</em>` : Makes the text emphasized. It doesn't look different from `<i>`, italic one but it is different for machines such as screen readers.  
* `<strong>`text`</strong>` : Makes the text strongly emhasized. It doesn't look different from `<b>` (bold) formatting but it is different for machines such as screen readers like `<em>`


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    Formatting page content
    In this series of exercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to format basic page content.
    Adding headings
    Headings help define the structure of the page and control the hierarchy of the content. You can use heading values ranging from a top-level heading of h1 all the way down to an h6. While there are several competing theories on the exact strategy to use when choosing headings, what really matters is that you are using them in an intelligent  manner, to accurately reflect the importance of your content. It's also important to be consistent in how you use headings across your site, so deciding on when and how to use headings is an important part of planning your site.
    Using paragraphs
    The paragraph tag (&lang;p&rang;) is one of the most basic formatting tags, and one that you'll use often. It indicates a paragraph of text, and should be used for each individual paragraph.
    Line breaks
    Occasionally you'll need to perform a "soft return," that is, create a new line without using a new paragraph. To do that in HTML, you use the line break tag (&lang;br&rang;). Line break tags are inline, meaning you can use them within headers and paragraphs, and don't require a closing tag.
    Let's say you were formatting an address, for example. You could use line breaks to make sure each line of the address appeared on a separate line, but still remained within the same paragraph.

### 2.3.3. Formatting paragraphs

When you use the `<p>` elements on your code you can't see the big differences before and after. However, it is important for the browsers and other code reader machines so make sure every paragraph block is defined by different `<p>` element.

### 2.3.4. Controlling line breaks

We will focus on the last paragraph of the code, adress part in this study. We want to some line breaks for this adress line but we don't want to define them each one by `<p>` element because they're logically belong to the same block. So we can use `<br>` element. The line break element, `<br>`, doesn't need a closing tag.

### 2.3.5. Emphasizing text

When we want to emphasize a part of a text, we use `<em>` and `<strong>` elements. These elements look like `<i>` and `<b>` tags on the browser but beyond the presentation they also have logic behind them. Maybe browsers can see the differences but other machines such as screen readers, can use that emphasized parts differently.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Formatting Page Content</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>HTML Essential Training</h1>
		<h2>Formatting page content</h2>
		<p>In this series of exercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to format basic page content.</p>
		<h3>Emphasizing text</h3>
		<p>Often you will want to emphasize a particular phrase or word within your text. HTML gives you several different tags to do this with. In this exercise we'll explore the four most common formatting tags you'll use to emphasize content.</p>
		<dl>
		<dt><b>The Bold Tag</b></dt>
		<dd>The bold tag (&lang;b&rang;) is mean to represent a span of text that you wish to set apart stylistically from the rest of the text without inferring any type of special relevance or meaning. It was removed in XHTML as being solely presentational, but added back to HTML5. As you would expect, browsers typically <b>bold</b> this text.</dd>
		<dt><b>The Strong Tag</b></dt>
		<dd>By using the strong tag (&lang;strong&rang;) you are representing a string of text as having strong importance. The text should be considered to be more important than the text surrounding it. It is typically displayed as <b>bold</b>.</dd>
		<dt><b>The Italic Tag</b></dt>
		<dd>Like the bold tag, the italic tag (&lang;i&rang;) represents a string of text that is set apart stylistically from the text around it. No particular meaning is attached to the text, rather it is rendered in italics. Helpful for phrases, terms, or any text that is normally displayed in <i>italics</i>.</dd>
		<dt><b>The Emphasis Tag</b></dt>
		<dd>The emphasis tag (&lang;em&rang;), or "em" tag, denotes text that is emphasized more than the text around it. Although this tag is usually rendered in <i>italics</i>, it shouldn't be used in place of the italics tag, rather it should be used for text that needs to emphasized for some reason.</dd></dl>
		<h3>Wait.... what?</h3>
		<p>You're probably wondering why there are multiple tags for bolding and italicizing text. If you are, don't worry, <strong>you're not alone!</strong> This is one of the most confusing aspects of learning HTML. The easiest way for me to explain it is this: One set of tags is <em>presentational</em>, while the other is <em>logical</em>. What that means is that presentational text doesn't convey explicit meaning, it merely serves to change the styling of the text. Logical elements however do convey a specific meaning. Text that is either bold or italic are just that, bold or italic. Text that is represented with a strong or em tag can represent multiple states. Using styles, for example, you could change it so that the text is underlined or highlighted. By contrast, it wouldn't make much sense to change the styling of a bold or italic element, since they are represented exactly as intended.</p>
		<p>There are other elements you'll need to research when learning about emphasizing text as well. The <b>cite</b> tag (&lang;cite&rang;), for example, is used for citing a work such as a book title, or an author, and is usually displayed as italicized text.</p>

### 2.3.6. Displaying special characters

Sometimes we need special characters that not exist on our keyboards. Or we need just a bracket "<" sign as a text but when we use it, the code editor or the browser thinks that is a syntax error and it can cause some rendering problems. There are special codes for that. For example the bracket sign, '<' is `&lang;` in coding world and it looks like this : &lang;

If we want to use the symbols in the text, we can use `&amp;amp;` which is looks like **&amp;amp;** .

Check the example code below.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Formatting page content</title>
  </head>
  <body>
		<h1>HTML Essential Training</h1>
    <h2>Formatting page content</h2>
    <p>In this series of exercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to format basic page content.</p>
    <h3>Displaying special characters</h3>
    <p>Certain characters are reserved for HTML, meaning that you aren't allowed to use them in regular content. Using a left angle bracket like this "&lang;" in your code can cause rendering issues in certain situations. Other characters are special characters or symbols that might not be available through the keyboard, or are used by other languages. To represent those characters in normal text, you can use what are known as named character entities.</p>
    <p>These are special codes that the browser or user agent will then replace with the requested character. The syntax for them is relatively straightforward. You start with an ampersand (&amp;) followed by the named entity that is then followed by a semicolon. To display an ampersand, for example, you would type in &amp;amp;. This can be extremely helpful when displaying &copy; and &trade; symbols, or writing mathematical formulas.</p>
    <p>You can find a very thorough list of named character entities on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

### 2.3.7. Controlling whitespace

The browsers ignore everything except first space character about whitespaces. So if you want to whitespaces that needs to view on browser right you can use non-breaking space, `&nbsp;`. For example if there is a brand name consist of few words, such as "Formula One" and you don't want to seperate these words in what circumtances such as responsive display result, you can use `&nbsp;` to make them together.

It helps you to control whitespaces but not recommend for formatting the visual side of page.


```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Formatting page content</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>HTML Essential Training</h1>
    <h2>Formatting page content</h2>
    <p>In this series of exercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to format basic page content.</p>
    <h3>Controlling white space</h3>
    <p>By default, browsers will ignore any white space after the first space. To add additional white space, you must use the &amp;nbsp; entity.</p>
    <p>Try it here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add as much white space as you want here.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that the primary purpose of the non-breaking space is to inform browsers when a line break shouldn't occur during a string of text. For example, adding a non-breaking space between Formula&nbsp;One would ensure that a line break never occurs that would split up the words Formula and One. To that end, never use the non-breaking space character to control paragraph indentations or fake a tab character. CSS should control that type of visual formatting.</p>

### 2.3.8. Displaying images

Images are one of the **replaced contents**. It means your code doesn't have the images actually, it calls them another resources. The resources can be a local file or another website.

When you add an image to your page, you use that code base :

`<img src="some_source_path" alt="image description" width="some_pixel" height="some_pixel"`

In the above example, `src` is the path or URL of the image that we want to add. If the image doesn't load correctly, `alt` is for defining the image to the users and other devices such as screen reader. `width` and `height` are for controlling the image size.

Also we can control the align of the images by `align=""` attribute but it's not recommend. Because the CSS is more useful for that.

Check the example code below.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Formatting page content</title>
  </head>
  <body>
		<h1>HTML Essential Training</h1>
    <h2>Formatting page content</h2>
    <p>In this series of exercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to format basic page content.</p>
    <h3>Inserting images</h3>
    <p><img src="https://thumbs.imagekind.com/6257614_650/South-Carolina-Lowcountry-Coastal-Scenic_art.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="Lowcountry South Carolina">Images are placed on the page through the use of the <b>img</b> tag. Images are considered <b>replaced content</b>, that is the element is replaced with the asset it references. The image element has several important attributes. The <b>src</b> attribute is used to tell the browser where to find the image. The <b>alt</b> attribute allows you to pass along descriptive text representing the image. This can be used by screen readers, or displayed in the event the image fails to load.The <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> are optional and can be used to pass the dimensions of the image to the browser. If omitted, the browser will still display the image at its native width and height. These values can be changed to force the browser to size the image differently from it's native size.</p>
    <p><img src="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/67/74/02/240_F_67740246_Ild4U8OHeNgVCK0riYiUDzmlsQ2YcVqk.jpg" width="350" height="240" alt="South Carolina flag">Most browser support a wide range of image types. For the most part, you're safe using jpg, png, gif, bmp, and svg image formats.</p>
<p>Insert a new image beside this text.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 2.3.9. Challenge: Formatting page content
***You can find the original and edited files of this challenge [here](https://github.com/hevalhazalkurt/Learn_Code_Study_Notes/tree/master/Lynda/Become_Wordpress_Developer_path/2_HTML_Essential_Training/Notes/Chalenges/01_Formatting_Page_Content_Challenge)***

Challenge instructions for Chapter 03: Formatting Page Content

Welcome to your first challenge! In this course’s challenges, you’ll work on completing the HTML Essential Training reference site. You won’t be building the site from scratch, rather you’ll be completing various portions of the site in varying degrees of completion. The goal is to reinforce and put into practice what you’ve learned in this chapter.

For this challenge you’ll be planning and implementing a formatting strategy for the site. In the steps below I’ll list the tasks you need to perform, as well as the relevant files for each task.

1.	Determine a heading strategy.
	* Applies to: All pages
	* Explore each of the pages (intro.htm, links.htm, next.htm, reference.htm, structure.htm and syntax.htm) and carefully read through the text.
	* Determine which content should be represented as headings, and then which level of headings you should use for each page. Focus on being consistent in how you assign headings for each page.
	* Go through each of the pages, and format headings based on your strategy.

2.	Format paragraphs
	* Applies to: intro.htm
	* Determine which content should be represented by paragraphs and then format them appropriately.

3.	Controlling line breaks
	* Applies to: next.htm
	* In the section under “learning web design” there are four recommendations. Each recommendation has an initial sentence followed by descriptive text. Using a line break, format these paragraphs so their initial sentence appears on its own line.

4.	Determining emphasis
	* Applies to: next.htm
	* In the file next.htm examine the four pieces of advice in the Learning Web Design section. Determine how to best emphasize the first line in each paragraph. Think about ways that you could isolate that line or emphasize it in a way that denotes its importance to the rest of the paragraph.
	* In the last advice paragraph (“break things”), display the quotes in italics. In the same paragraph, emphasize the last line “Always challenge yourself” so that it’s importance is indicated.
	* In the list of resources below the advice section, make sure all top-level list items appear in bold.

5.	Displaying special characters
	* Applies to: reference.htm
	* Scroll down and find the table that displays common named character entities.
	* Preview the page in a browser, and using the table as a reference, add the appropriate entity into the first table cell to provide an example of that character.
	* In the definition for Elements, wrap the word "tags" in quotes using a left and right quote special character.

6.	Inserting Images
	* Applies to: Intro.htm
	* Examine the existing image at the top of the page. Note the class “flowRight” which is used by CSS to control styling. You’ll learn more about this in the chapter on CSS.
	* Scroll down until you locate the paragraph “Shortly After the 1.0 specification…” At the beginning of that paragraph insert an image that:
		* points to the 200px-W3C_icon.png in the `_images` directory
		* uses the alt text “W3C logo”
		* passes the value of 200 for width, and 136 for height
		* applies a class of “flowLeft”			

When you're finished, open up the same files from the "finished_files" directory and compare your results with mine. Do they match? Were there times when you disagreed with the strategy I used for headers, creating lists, or emphasizing text? Often these decisions are judgment calls, and don't necessarily have a "right" answer. What's important is that you have a sound reason for making the decision you did that's based on valid, semantic HTML. For more practice, go through the files and compare your formatting to the existing formatting. Is it consistent? Is the formatting what you expect, or would you make changes?
