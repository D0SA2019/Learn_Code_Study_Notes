You can find the worksheet of this study [here](https://github.com/hevalhazalkurt/Learn_Code_Study_Notes/blob/master/Lynda/Become_Wordpress_Developer_path/2_HTML_Essential_Training/Notes/2.7_Controlling_Styling.html).

### 2.7.1. HTML and CSS

Every browser has a default style to visualize for the web pages, but it's not enough to make good pages. So every time we add style to the page we overwrite the defaults of browsers and to make this happen, we need some CSS knowledge.

To add CSS code to our web page, we use `<style> some CSS codes </style>` in the `<head>` element. First, let's see the raw code that we use for this part.


```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>HTML and CSS</title>
</head>

<body>
	<h1>HTML and CSS</h1>
	<p>One way to visualize how HTML and CSS work together is to think about a new building under construction. As the building goes up, the structure of the building is built first. At just the structural level, all you see is the frame of the new
		building, and other than the basic shape, you don&rsquo;t really know how the building is going to look. Once the frame is complete, the &ldquo;skin&rdquo; of the building is added. This could be brick, wood, glass, stucco, or any number of outer
		materials that determine what the final look of the building will be.</p>
	<p>HTML and CSS work much the same way. HTML gives us the structure, or &ldquo;frame&rdquo;, of our pages. We can use CSS to then control how this structure looks, where elements are positioned, and add additional decorative styling. What&rsquo;s
		more, much the same way a building can change dramatically by adding a new façade; web pages can change their visual design by simply changing the page&rsquo;s CSS.</p>
	<p>This separation of structure and presentation creates a very flexible and efficient workflow where the structure of pages is independent of how the pages are presented. This allows you to update styling without changing page content, and provide
		different visual designs based on the context of where the page is being displayed. </p>
	<h2>Allow me to demonstrate</h2>
</body>

</html>
```

CSS is like a sequence of the rules. For these rules, we have a selector such as `body`, `p`, `h1`. Every selector represents a bit part of that web page and has some rules consists of properties and values. For example :

```css
body {
	background-color: #004693 ;
	font-size: 15px;
}
```

If we add some CSS code our page...

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>HTML and CSS</title>
	<style>
		body {
			margin: 0 auto;
			width: 70%;
			font: 100% Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
		}

		p {
			width: 40%;
			line-height: 1.8;
			text-align: justify;
		}

		h1 {
			font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
			font-size: 1.6em;
		}

		h2 {
			font-size: 2em;
			color: #666;
			position: fixed;
			top: 40px;
			right: 40px;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<h1>HTML and CSS</h1>

### 2.7.2. Creating inline styles

We can change the style of a single element on HTML without big `<style>` codes. It called as `inline` style. Inline style is doable but not recommended because it's not an efficient way to style a page. But if you develop an email template with HTML, so it can be useful.

Let's check our raw code that we use below :

```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Inline styles</title>
</head>

<body>
	<h1>Using inline styles</h1>
	<h2>Style me using the "style" attribute.</h2>
</body>

</html>
```

If we want to some style change on `<h2>` element, we can use `style=""` attribute.

```html
<h1>Using inline styles</h1>
<h2 style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">Style me using the "style" attribute.</h2>
```

#### `Before / After` :

![](http://i66.tinypic.com/xfz0w0.png)


### 2.7.3. The style element

To add the style all element in the web page, we use `<style>` element. We can make the same style of the previous part with that method.


```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Inline styles</title>
	<style>
		h2 {
			color : red;
			font-weight: normal;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<h1>Using inline styles</h1>
	<h2>Style me using the "style" attribute.</h2>
</body>

</html>
```

#### `Preview` :

![](http://i65.tinypic.com/2zo97vs.png)


We can use `<style>` element with `class` attribute for more customization. For example :

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Inline styles</title>
	<style>
		.alert {
			color : red;
			font-weight: normal;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<h1>Using inline styles</h1>
	<h2 class="alert">Style me using the "style" attribute.</h2>
	<h2>Global styles apply to all instances of the element.</h2>
</body>

</html>
```

#### `Preview` :

![](http://i66.tinypic.com/2s80i8l.png)


We can use a class more than one element.


```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Inline styles</title>
	<style>
		.alert {
			color : red;
			font-weight: normal;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<h1 class="alert">Using inline styles</h1>
	<h2 class="alert">Style me using the "style" attribute.</h2>
	<h2>Global styles apply to all instances of the element.</h2>
</body>

</html>
```

#### `Preview` :
![](http://i64.tinypic.com/282q68i.png)


Or we can make the style more specific.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Inline styles</title>
	<style>
		h2.alert {
			color : red;
			font-weight: normal;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<h1 class="alert">Using inline styles</h1>
	<h2 class="alert">Style me using the "style" attribute.</h2>
	<h2>Global styles apply to all instances of the element.</h2>
</body>

</html>
```

### 2.7.4. Controlling typography

Check the example code below :

```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Controlling typography</title>
	<style>
		body {
			width: 70%;
			margin: 0 auto;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<h1>HTML and CSS</h1>
	<p>One way to visualize how HTML and CSS work together is to think about a new building under construction. As the building goes up, the structure of the building is built first. At just the structural level, all you see is the frame of the new
		building, and other than the basic shape, you don&rsquo;t really know how the building is going to look. Once the frame is complete, the &ldquo;skin&rdquo; of the building is added. This could be brick, wood, glass, stucco, or any number of outer
		materials that determine what the final look of the building will be.</p>
	<p>HTML and CSS work much the same way. HTML gives us the structure, or &ldquo;frame&rdquo;, of our pages. We can use CSS to then control how this structure looks, where elements are positioned, and add additional decorative styling. What&rsquo;s
		more, much the same way a building can change dramatically by adding a new façade; web pages can change their visual design by simply changing the page&rsquo;s CSS.</p>
	<p>This separation of structure and presentation creates a very flexible and efficient workflow where the structure of pages is independent of how the pages are presented. This allows you to update styling without changing page content, and provide
		different visual designs based on the context of where the page is being displayed.</p>
</body>

</html>
```

As you can see, we have only `body` rules on `<style>` element. These rules are :

* `width: 70%;` : Makes the content size 70% of the page
* `margin: 0 auto;` : Aligns content center of the page

#### `Preview` :

![](http://i68.tinypic.com/2iidds6.png)


Now we're going to add some typography style to our page.

```HTML
<style>
	body {
		width: 70%;
		margin: 0 auto;
		font: 100% Arial, Hevetica, sans-serif;
	}

	h1 {
		font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif;
		font-size: 2em;
		font-weight: normal;
		font-style: italic;
		margin : 1em 0 .04em;
	}

	p {
		font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
		font-size: 1em;
		line-height: 1.6;
		text-align: justify;
		width: 60%;
		margin: 0;
		margin-bottom: 1em;
	}
</style>
```

Look at some examples :  

* `font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif; ` : Defines the font of the element. We have two font here because we say to the computer "Use Georgia, but if you don't have Georgia use Times New Roman. If you don't have both, just use a font from serif family." for this element.
* `font-size: 2em;` : Defines the font size of the element. We can define size as pixel but `em` is more flexible. Because it says to the browser : "Whatever your default font size is give to the element twice that."
* `line-height: 1.6;` : Defines the height between two line on the element.
* `text-align: justify;` : Aligns text content as justified
* `body { font: 100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; }` : When we add a font to the `body` element we say "use the rules for all page except the given specific rule ones".

### 2.7.5. Adding color

* `background-color` : Defines the element's background color. If you add this rule on the `html` element all your page's background color changes.
* `background` : We can add the color rue here too. Also, this rule can consist of color, background picture and other options.
* `border` : Makes border to the chosen element.
* `color` : Defines the element's color.

```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Inline styles</title>
	<style>
		html {
			margin: 0;
			padding: 0;
			background-color: #777;
		}

		body {
			width: 70%;
			margin: 0 auto;
			font: 100% Arial, Hevetica, sans-serif;
			padding: 1em 50px;
			background : white;
			border-bottom: 10px solid gold;
		}

		h1 {
			font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif;
			font-size: 2em;
			font-weight: normal;
			font-style: italic;
			margin: 1em 0 .04em;
			background : rgb(44, 45, 140);
			color: #ddd;
		}

		p {
			font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
			font-size: 1em;
			line-height: 1.6;
			text-align: justify;
			width: 60%;
			margin: 0;
			margin-bottom: 1em;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>

</body>

</html>
```

### 2.7.6. Externalizing styles

So far, we learn to apply the styles by embedded directly to the page. It's good for a specific page, but if we make a webpage consists of lots of pages, we need a more efficient way. And the way is to get the style from an external source. To do this, we need to create a new document as `style.css` and copy all style rules to this document. After that we can define the `rel`ationship between HTML and CSS document by `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` line on the `<head>` element.

Check the example code below :


```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Inline styles</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>

	<h1>HTML and CSS</h1>

</body>

</html>
```


#### `Before / After` :

As you can see the example below, the result is the same.

### 2.7.7. Challenge : Controlling basic styling

Challenge instructions for Chapter 07: Controlling Styling

In this challenge, you’ll work on the sample HTML Training reference site to add site-wide styling to the pages and enhance the page's layout and formatting through writing styles

1.	Link external style sheet site-wide
	* Applies to: all pages
	* In the head of each page, use the link element to link to the styles.css file. Be sure to remember to define the styles.css relationship as stylesheet.

2.	Set the background color of pages
	* Applies to: styles.css
	* In the styles.css file, find the html,body rule (which controls the html and body element)
	* Set the background color to #663399. As a bonus, if you remember how to format a comment in CSS, add the comment 'Beccapurple' after the color definition.

3.	Float images
	* Applies to: styles.css
	* Find the .flowRight and .flowLeft selectors (around line 98)
	* Set the float property for flowRight to right and flowLeft to left
	* The float property controls how elements position themselves and how content flows around them. Preview the intro.htm page and note no change to how text flows around the images. Using a class attribute apply the "floatRight" class to the first image, and the "floatLeft" class to the second image.
	* Save and preview the intro.htm file again to see how the text flows around the images based on the class applied to them. This highlights the power that the class attribute gives us when styling specific elements.

3.	Set site-wide typography
	* Applies to: styles.css
	* Write a rule that sets the page's default font size to 100% of the user agent's default, and that requests Verdana as the font-family. Set Geneva and the default sans-serif families as fallbacks. Try to do all of this in a single rule if possible.

Take time to save and preview the site as you modify the styles. After you're finished, go through the style sheet. Try to match the selectors you see to the elements on pages and determine what the properties in the rule are controlling. Don't worry if you don't immediately recognize which element's the selectors are targeting, the goal is to begin the process of understanding how CSS selectors target elements on the page, and how changing certain properties effects those elements visually.
