# 2. HTML Essential Training
## 2.4. Structuring Content

You can find the worksheet of this study [here](https://github.com/hevalhazalkurt/Learn_Code_Study_Notes/blob/master/Lynda/Become_Wordpress_Developer_path/2_HTML_Essential_Training/Notes/2.4_Structuring_Content.html) and [here](https://github.com/hevalhazalkurt/Learn_Code_Study_Notes/blob/master/Lynda/Become_Wordpress_Developer_path/2_HTML_Essential_Training/Notes/2.4_Structuring_Content_1.html).

### 2.4.1. The value of structure

Let's look at standart layout of webpages.

![](http://i63.tinypic.com/rt3tb4.png)

This page looks like this on coder side :

![](http://i64.tinypic.com/2e5qn0g.png)

If the page’s structured properly, the page content will have the hierarchy, and the user can understand how the content relates to each other. That’s why HTML sectioning and heading elements are essential. They can group contents in semantic meaning. These are :

**Sectioning Elements**
* `<h1>`...`<h6>`
* `<article>`
* `<aside>`
* `<nav>`
* `<section>`

**Semantic Elements**
* `<header>`
* `<main>`
* `<footer>`

### 2.4.2. Controlling document outlines

HTML uses semantic elements like heading and sectioning tags to describe the outline of the page’s content. We will focus that in this part. Here is the code that we work on it.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Controlling document outlines</title>
</head>

<p>Spotlight favorite</p>
<p>One of my favorite albums has always been Radiohead's OK Computer. It's such a transitional album, as it bridges the gap between sweeping, album-based releases to the present day scene of downloaded songs that aren't consumed in the framework of a larger piece. Rolling Stone once called it the &quot;last great album,&quot; and they might have been right!</p>

```

It looks like this on the browser :

![](http://i64.tinypic.com/35d191t.png)

As you can see from the above example, there is no structure. All elements and contents are like the same level.

If you want to check your code’s outline structure, you can copy and paste your code here :  https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/

For our code, the result is :

![](http://i63.tinypic.com/15xli7s.png)

Now, we will make some structure our raw code.

* We will add the headings.
* We will define the content's article part by `<article>`
* We will define the content sections by `<section>`
* We will define the related content part with the main content by `<aside>`

```html

### 2.4.3. The nav element
The `<nav>` element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or parts within the page: a section with navigation links.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<h3> Conveying meaning through structure </h3>
<p>Creating properly structured pages is the foundation of any good website. A solid semantic structure allows you to convey meaning and properly represent content types through nothing more than the page's markup. This, in turn, makes your content more accessible, easier to index and search, and makes it easier to repurpose. Remember that there are a lot of different devices, robots, and other user agents that will be reading your code. <em>Without a consistent, semantic structure your site will be less effective.</em> </p>

</body>
</html>

### 2.4.4. The article element

The `<article>` element represents a complete, or self-contained, the composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g., in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

Check this example code :

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Introduction to HTML</title>
<link href="_css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

  <h3> Conveying meaning through structure </h3>
  <p>Creating properly structured pages is the foundation of any good website.

Remember that there are a lot of different devices, robots, and other user agents that will be reading your code. <em>Without a consistent, semantic structure your site will be less effective.</em> </p>
  <h3>Sectioning elements </h3>
  <p>One way to add meaning to your content is to organize them into sections that convey meaning and structure. For example it's pretty standard to contain introductory information within a section, page navigation within its own area, the page's main content in its own region, and related information within a sidebar. HTML contains numerous elements that are designed to assist in the logical structuring and semantics of page content. </p>
  <p>In previous versions of HTML creating new sections of content was done almost exclusively through the use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements" title="heading elements"><b>heading</b></a> tags, with <b>divs</b> being used to group areas of content together. <b>Class</b> or <b>ID</b> attributes would allow designers to attach more semantic meaning to the groups, although this meant little to most user agents. In HTML5 new sectioning and semantic elements were introduced to help represent commonly used sections and create more consistent page structures. Tags like the <b>aside</b>, <b>article</b>, <b>footer</b>, <b>header</b>, <b>main</b>, <b>nav</b>, and <b>section</b> allow authors to identify common page regions and convey more semantic meaning. </p>

### 2.4.5. The section element

The `<section>` element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content. The theme of each `section` should be identified, typically by including a heading as a child of the `<section>` element.

Check the example code below :  

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Introduction to HTML</title>
<link href="_css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

  <h3>Document outlines </h3>
  <p>One of the fundamental concepts of HTML is that its documents can be represented by a document outline that summarizes the content of the page. Imagine a page being represented by a table of contents and you'll have a good idea of what one of these outlines might look like. These outlines assist in tasks such as quickly searching documents and making content easier to navigate for assistive devices. </p>
  <p>Prior to HTML5, document outlines were generated entirely through the use of headings. An H1 at the top of the page would serve to identify the page content, and subsequent headings would create sections and subsections inside of it. This meant that having a strategy for when to use certain headings was critical for maintaining consistent document structure. In HTML5 a new outline algorithm was introduced that added the new sectioning elements to the heading elements and created a more sophisticated outlining model. Although not currently implemented by user agents it is still recommended that authors familiarize themselves with it so that they're using the new sectioning and semantic tags properly. </p>
  <p>It is still considered to be a best practice to use heading tags to establish the document outline. Mozilla has a fantastic article on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document" title="Mozilla Dev article on HTML sections">sections and outlines</a> in HTML documents that I strongly recommend reading.</p>
  <h4>W3C Warning</h4>
  <p>At the time of the authoring of this course, the W3C had posted this warning regarding the HTML5 outline algorithm:</p>
  <blockquote>There are currently no known implementations of the outline algorithm in graphical browsers or assistive technology user agents, although the algorithm is implemented in other software such as conformance checkers. Therefore the outline algorithm cannot be relied upon to convey document structure to users. Authors are advised to use heading rank (h1-h6) to convey document structure.</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>WAI-ARIA Roles</h3>
  <p>Carefully structuring an HTML page is the first step into ensuring that the content is accessible to all users. You should also use WAI-ARIA role attributes where appropriate to increase accessibility and improve semantics. WAI-ARIA is short for the Web Accessibility Initiative's Accessible Rich Internet Application specification. The roles attribute attempts to identify content and its capabilities by assigning it to a predefined role. This helps assistive devices understand what the content is, how it relates to other content, and how the content can be interacted with. The W3C has a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-aria-in-html-20140626/" title="Using WAI-ARIA in HTML">fantastic resource</a> on how WAI-ARIA works and how it should be used with HTML.</p>

### 2.4.6. The aside element
The `<aside>` element represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the `<aside>` element, and which could be considered separate from that content. Such sections are often represented as sidebars and printed typography.

Check the example code below :

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">

<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Introduction to HTML</title>

### 2.4.7. The div element
The `<div>` element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. It can be used with the `<class>`, `<lang>`, and `<title>` attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements.

Check the example code below :

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Controlling document outlines</title>
    <style>
        .book {
            background: #369;
            padding:16px;
            width: 250px;
            color: white;
            margin-bottom: 16px;
        }
        .book h5 {
            font: 1.2em Arial, sans-serif;
            margin: 0;

    <h3>Spotlight favorite</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite albums has always been Radiohead's OK Computer. It's such a transitional album, as it bridges the gap between sweeping, album-based releases to the present day scene of downloaded songs that aren't consumed in the framework of a larger piece. Rolling Stone once called it the &quot;last great album,&quot; and they might have been right!</p>

### 2.4.8. Other semantic elements

* The `<header>` element represents introductory content for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A `<header>` typically contains a group of introductory or navigational aids. The page can contain more than one `<header>` section.

* The `<footer>` element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectinioning root element. A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copright data, and the like.

* The `<main>` element represents the main content of the `<body>` of a document or application. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document or central functionality of an application.

Check the example code below :

      <h3> Conveying meaning through structure </h3>
      <p>Creating properly structured pages is the foundation of any good website. A solid semantic structure allows you to convey meaning and properly represent content types through nothing more than the page's markup. This, in turn, makes your content more accessible, easier to index and search, and makes it easier to repurpose. Remember that there are a lot of different devices, robots, and other user agents that will be reading your code. <em>Without a consistent, semantic structure your site will be less effective.</em> </p>
    </header>
    <section>
      <h3>Sectioning elements </h3>
      <p>One way to add meaning to your content is to organize them into sections that convey meaning and structure. For example it's pretty standard to contain introductory information within a section, page navigation within its own area, the page's main content in its own region, and related information within a sidebar. HTML contains numerous elements that are designed to assist in the logical structuring and semantics of page content. </p>
      <p>In previous versions of HTML creating new sections of content was done almost exclusively through the use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements" title="heading elements"><b>heading</b></a> tags, with <b>divs</b> being used to group areas of content together. <b>Class</b> or <b>ID</b> attributes would allow designers to attach more semantic meaning to the groups, although this meant little to most user agents. In HTML5 new sectioning and semantic elements were introduced to help represent commonly used sections and create more consistent page structures. Tags like the <b>aside</b>, <b>article</b>, <b>footer</b>, <b>header</b>, <b>main</b>, <b>nav</b>, and <b>section</b> allow authors to identify common page regions and convey more semantic meaning. </p>
      <p>Although some of these elements are very specific, in many cases which element you'll use and how you'll structure them is very much a judgment call. Make sure, however, that your finished structure represents the desired document outline. </p>

      <h3>Document outlines </h3>
      <p>One of the fundamental concepts of HTML is that its documents can be represented by a document outline that summarizes the content of the page. Imagine a page being represented by a table of contents and you'll have a good idea of what one of these outlines might look like. These outlines assist in tasks such as quickly searching documents and making content easier to navigate for assistive devices. </p>
      <p>Prior to HTML5, document outlines were generated entirely through the use of headings. An H1 at the top of the page would serve to identify the page content, and subsequent headings would create sections and subsections inside of it. This meant that having a strategy for when to use certain headings was critical for maintaining consistent document structure. In HTML5 a new outline algorithm was introduced that added the new sectioning elements to the heading elements and created a more sophisticated outlining model. Although not currently implemented by user agents it is still recommended that authors familiarize themselves with it so that they're using the new sectioning and semantic tags properly. </p>
      <p>It is still considered to be a best practice to use heading tags to establish the document outline. Mozilla has a fantastic article on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document" title="Mozilla Dev article on HTML sections">sections and outlines</a> in HTML documents that I strongly recommend reading.</p>
      <aside>
        <h4>W3C Warning</h4>
        <p>At the time of the authoring of this course, the W3C had posted this warning regarding the HTML5 outline algorithm:</p>
        <blockquote>There are currently no known implementations of the outline algorithm in graphical browsers or assistive technology user agents, although the algorithm is implemented in other software such as conformance checkers. Therefore the outline algorithm cannot be relied upon to convey document structure to users. Authors are advised to use heading rank (h1-h6) to convey document structure.</blockquote>

      <h3>WAI-ARIA Roles</h3>
      <p>Carefully structuring an HTML page is the first step into ensuring that the content is accessible to all users. You should also use WAI-ARIA role attributes where appropriate to increase accessibility and improve semantics. WAI-ARIA is short for the Web Accessibility Initiative's Accessible Rich Internet Application specification. The roles attribute attempts to identify content and its capabilities by assigning it to a predefined role. This helps assistive devices understand what the content is, how it relates to other content, and how the content can be interacted with. The W3C has a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-aria-in-html-20140626/" title="Using WAI-ARIA in HTML">fantastic resource</a> on how WAI-ARIA works and how it should be used with HTML.</p>

### 2.4.9. Using WAI-ARIA roles
The following **roles** are regions of the page intended as navigational **landmarks**. All of these roles inherit from the `landmark` base type and, with the exception of application, all are imported from the Role Attribute. The roles are included here in order to make them clearly part of the WAI-ARIA Role taxonomy.

* `application`
* `banner`
* `complementary`
* `contentinfo`
* `form`
* `main`
* `navigation`
* `search`

Check the example code below :

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Introduction to HTML</title>
<link href="_css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

### 2.4.10. Challenge: Adding sectioning content
Challenge instructions for Chapter 04: Structuring Page Content

For this challenge you’ll be planning and implementing a semantic structuring strategy for the entire site based on the work we completed in the chapter. In the steps below I’ll list the tasks you need to perform, as well as the relevant files for each task.

1.	Determine a structuring strategy.
    * Applies to: structure.htm
    * Open the structure.htm file and explore the page structure and ARIA roles. Write out the document outline, and how structural tags like aside, article, nav, and section are being used.
    * Examine how semantic tags like the header, footer, and main elements are used.

2.	Structure pages
    * Applies to: all pages
    * Using the strategy devised from the structure.htm file, structure each of the remaining files so that the site uses a consistent, logical structure.

3.	Apply ARIA roles
    * Applies to: all pages
    * As you are structuring pages, add ARIA roles to elements when appropriate.

When you're finished, open up the same files from the "finished_files" directory and compare your results to the finished files. Make sure they match and that the structure is consistent throughout.
