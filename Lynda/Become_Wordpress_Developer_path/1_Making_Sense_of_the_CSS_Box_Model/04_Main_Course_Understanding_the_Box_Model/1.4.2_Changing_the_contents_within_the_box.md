# Making Sense of the CSS Box Model
## 1.4. Main Course Understanding the Box Model
### 1.4.2 - Changing the contents within the box

When working from the inside out, we first try to display the **content** box. Changing the font, size and color of the article are the first steps in styling the content.

Previously, we learned that we could use `letter-spacing` for the space between the letters. `word-spacing` is used to determine the gap between words. We can also use `text-indent` functions if we want to have an indentation at the beginning of the paragraph.

CSS is also used for text transformation. For this, we use the `text-transform` feature and one of the `capitalize`, `lowercase`, `uppercase` options. For text decoration, the `text-decoration` function can be used with` underline`.

When using the `color` property to change the color of the text, the `text-shadow` can also be used as a shadow.

Apart from the arrangements in the articles, the box itself can also be modified. `background-color` is used to change the background color of the box.

The `background: url(");` property can be used to add visual images to the background. It can also be determined how the background image will be aligned and whether it will repeat itself according to the size of the box.

You can also use the `background-size` feature to adjust the size of the background image. This allows the `cover` image assigned to this feature to cover the entire box.

We can also shape the outside of the box with the inside. With `box-shadow`, we can give shadow, determine the color of the shadow,  and we can set the roundness ratios of the box edges by `border-radius`.
