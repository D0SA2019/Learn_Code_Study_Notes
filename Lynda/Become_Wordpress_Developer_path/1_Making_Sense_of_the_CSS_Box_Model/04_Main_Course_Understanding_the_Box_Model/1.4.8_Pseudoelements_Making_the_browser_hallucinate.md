**Pseudo Classes** : Alter the display or behavior of all the contents inside an element box.
```css
Pseudo Classes
:active
:focus
:hover
:nth-child
:first-of-type
</>
```

**Pseudo Elements**: Alter the display or behavior of a certain part of the contents inside an element box.

```css
Pseudo Elements
::before
::after
::first-letter
::first-line
::selection
::backdrop
</>
```

`before` and `after` allow us to determine what we want to do at the beginning and end of an element. In the following example, we define quotation marks at the beginning and end of the quoted sentence. Text added as `content` is displayed here, but not selectable.

Since the elements that are arranged with `before` and `after ` are set separately from the originals, the changes made here are applied only to the parts that are made without change. This gives us many advantages at the design stage. In the following example, although the size and color of the quotation mark at the beginning of the quotation mark is changed, we see that there is no change in the quotation mark at the end and the quotation itself.

`first-letter`, as its name implies, allows you to make the desired change on the first letter of the selected element.

`first-line` allows you to make the desired changes on the first line of the selected element.

`first-of-type` changes all of the first element of the selected class group. In the following example, you can see the style applied on the first part of the content marked with `p`.

The `selection` property determines how we want a particular element to appear if it is selected by the user. In the following example, when the user selects normal fonts, there will be no changes, but the font and background color will change when the user selects the quoted section.
