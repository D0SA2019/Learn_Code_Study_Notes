# Making Sense of the CSS Box Model
## 1.4. Main Course Understanding the Box Model
### 1.4.3 - Understanding the display property

Each HTML element has its own default display option. Since we know how to manipulate boxes, we can address their relationship with these elements. According to the default display properties, elements are fully visible in full width using the available area. When `padding`, `border`, and `margin` properties are given to the element, the content pushes the box according to the assigned values.

Inline elements `padding`,` border` and `margin` properties may affect other contents around it.

For this reason, we can tell the browser to process and display an inline element according to the box model with `display inline-block`. However, when we do this, we should consider that the distances between the lines will change and that you will create visual disproportionately.

One of the `display` features is `flex`. We will discuss this in detail in the following lessons. However, we can look at the example below to see what it does.

Another `display` feature is `table`. If you want to have more control over content placement, `table` and `table-cell` are the best options.
