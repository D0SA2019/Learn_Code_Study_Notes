# Making Sense of the CSS Box Model
## 1.4. Main Course Understanding the Box Model
### 1.4.5 - Position is everything

When viewing the document and its elements, the browser displays the default state, one after the other.  We can edit how the display of elements in CSS with the `position` property. The default `position` setting of HTML is `static`, which means that elements are sorted according to the flow in the document.

To make the `position` property of an element `relative` means to determine its position relative to the normal flow in the document. The position of the element changes but that the position of the other elements in the layout does not change so that the elements can overlap, because of that it is useful to be careful when using it.

Setting the `position` to `absolute` means positioning `relative` relative to an upper element that includes it. If no such element is found, the object is positioned according to its normal flow in the document.

The `absolute` property is usually used when positioning elements that are connected to the position of another element, such as the description of the image.

The `fixed` property fixes the element relative to the area the browser displays regardless of all other variables.
