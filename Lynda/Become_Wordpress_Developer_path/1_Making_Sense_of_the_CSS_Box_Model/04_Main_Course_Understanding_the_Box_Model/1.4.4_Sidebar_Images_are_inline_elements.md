# Making Sense of the CSS Box Model
## 1.4. Main Course Understanding the Box Model
### 1.4.4 - Sidebar Images are inline elements

Images for HTML are inline elements that can be positioned in different ways in the text. The general perception of visuals is like emojis in a message. Due to this situation, there are some consequences of using images in the box model. However, it is not common for web design to be used as inline elements as shown below.

Due to the difficulty of HTML in visuals, designers are trying to solve this problem by using features like `float` and` background`. However, this does not change the fact that images are still an inline element, not a box. Therefore, it restricts the use of many features such as `padding`, `margin`, and `border` in the box model.

The best way to solve this situation is to set the `display` property of the image to `display: block`. So many more features that are more functional in the box model can be used easily.
