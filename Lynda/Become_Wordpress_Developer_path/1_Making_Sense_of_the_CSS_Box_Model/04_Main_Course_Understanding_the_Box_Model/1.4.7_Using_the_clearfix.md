### 1.4.7 - Using the clearfix

The `float` and `display` properties in nested boxes can be confusing for beginners. In the following example, you can see an example of nested boxes.

When we add the `float` property to the boxes in this example, the browser will not be able to resize the space used as a `description` according to the new layout. Instead, the code in that section crashes and displays incorrectly.

One solution is to add something new to the container in the background with the `::after` feature, so that it can recover itself again. This option is usually not preferred.

The `clearfix` property is more ideal to solve this problem. This solution basically involves adding empty content to the container, displaying it as a table, and then overriding it. The browser displays the layout correctly using this invisible element.

Using `display: flex` removes all these problems and additional element requirements like` clearfix`. Because it is not desirable to place empty elements among our code, even if they are empty.
