### 1.4.6 - Floating and clearing content

Although `position` options give good results with positioning, it is necessary to display an object next to another when creating a layout for a document. In traditional CSS, this is done with the `float` property.  The `left` and `right` options given to the `float` property determine the location of an object relative to another object, such as the text in the current display area.

In the case of two block elements, we can use `float` by positioning each one separately. In doing so, a value such as `width: 50%` determines how much of an existing field will be used for that element. This is usually useful when the dimensions are equal to two boxes.

On objects of different sizes, the `float` property can cause some errors. To override this, we can use the `clear` feature. This is used to wrap the object that used `clear` under the object positioned with `float`.

The `float` property can be used to form pages but can cause visual problems due to different sizes and lengths of content. `display: flex` is much more useful, although it does the same. In the example below, you can see the same content positioned with `float` and `flex`.
