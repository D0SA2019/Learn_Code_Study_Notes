# Making Sense of the CSS Box Model
## 1.4. Main Course Understanding the Box Model
### 1.4.1 - What is the CSS box model

When we add any tags to a document, the browser wraps around it and acts like a box. As shown in the following image, each tag creates a separate box. Using CSS, we can edit both the tag and the box's visual functions. Using the CSS box model, we give the browser information on how to display each box specific to it.

The CSS box is formed by four individual edges moving together. These boxes are sorted from inside to outside **content box**, **padding box**, **border box** and **margin box**.  If any CSS code is not applied to the content, all of these four boxes are the same, so they behave as one box. Although we have not set any CSS template, the browser implements some basic styling methods.

The content above is 100px to 155px without any CSS style. As mentioned in the previous lessons, this dimension can be shaped as we wish. As shown in the example below, we can use the `padding` function to specify the distance of the **border** box that wraps its contents. As shown in the example below, we can use the `padding` function to specify the distance of the **border** box that wraps its contents. In the example, the distance is given as `20px` in each direction; it can also be given as individual values for each edge.

Adding 20px in all directions to a box where the content is 100px, as in the example, means that the browser will display that content area as 140px. However, with `box-size: border-box`, we can tell the browser to fit content according to the display area.

The other box is **border**. `Padding` is actually an invisible alignment option when `border box` is visible. The border can be in any desired color and thickness.  In addition, borders can be shaped in different styles, such as **solid**, **dotted**, **double*,* **grooved**, **framed**, **inset**, and **outset**.

When we add `border` to the content, the size of our box expands by adding the dimensions our base border size. In our example, the right and left both 2px expands, and the viewing area is 144px in the final.

The last box that wraps all the edges is `margin`. `padding` aligns content from the inside, `margin` pushes them to the distance with content outside the box.  In the web world, there is normally no space between the contents or boxes, but default **whitespace** can be created with `margin`.
