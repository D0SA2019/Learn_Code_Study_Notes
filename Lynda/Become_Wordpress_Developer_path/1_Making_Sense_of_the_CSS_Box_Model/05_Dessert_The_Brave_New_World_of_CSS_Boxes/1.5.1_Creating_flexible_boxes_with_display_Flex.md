# Making Sense of the CSS Box Model
## 1.5. Dessert The Brave New World of CSS Boxes
### 1.5.1 - Creating flexible boxes with display Flex
CSS is constantly evolving to make it easier to encode complex designs. As this course is specifically focused on the box model, we focus on two innovations: flexible boxes and CSS shapes.

Below we see browsers that support CSS flexbox usage. You can click the link for the current list.

The first example of what can be done with flexbox is vertical centering.  This is also quite simple code. For this purpose, we want to use the box `display: flex;` and then the contents of `align-items: center;` and `justify-content: center;` is sufficient to align.

Flexbox is also very useful when creating columns of equal height in the use of CSS. We can easily place the columns side by side using only the `display: flex;` code. If we want a more detailed layout, we can place descriptive lines such as `width: calc(33% - 1em);` in addition to the column boxes.

We can change the order in which the boxes that we want to display side by side can be displayed without changing their markup. For this, we can use the `order` feature.

We can also reverse the order of the boxes with a single line of code. For this, it is enough to use `flex-direction: row-reverse;`.
