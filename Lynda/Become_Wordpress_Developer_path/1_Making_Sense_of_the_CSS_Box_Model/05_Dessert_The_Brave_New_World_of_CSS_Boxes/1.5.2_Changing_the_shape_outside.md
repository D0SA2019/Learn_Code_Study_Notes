# Making Sense of the CSS Box Model
## 1.5. Dessert The Brave New World of CSS Boxes
### 1.5.2 - Changing the shape outside
In CSS, each element is a box, and understanding the CSS box model means that you can do anything you want to do. However, in the box model, everything has four sides, and although we can show it in different ways with the properties like radius, every new feature we apply will have vertical edges. However, with CSS3, this problem can be overcome.  The `-webkit-shape-outside: circle ();` code is used for this.

For example, if we want the content to look like wrapped around the profile picture in our content with the following layout, we use the code as follows.

Similarly, polygonal structures can be created. However, the `-webKit-shape-outside` feature is not yet supported by all browsers. That's why it's important to be careful when using it.
