# Making Sense of the CSS Box Model
## 1.3. Entre The Origin of the Box in Typography
### 1.3.1 - Understanding the basics of type
When working with the CSS box model, it is ideal to start from the core and expand outward. In a web page, the core is `type`. The vast majority of content in the Internet world is text, so the vast majority of CSS features are about shaping the text. So we're going to start by understanding the techniques that go back to the traditional typography.

The paper will form the frame of a web page.

The place where the letters in a row end is called the **base line**.

Below the base line, there is space for the lower case letters as shown in the example above. This area, which is included from the top of the line to the lowest point, is called **point size**. This is also known as the **pixel size** in the digital world. 1em is the height and width of capital letters, regardless of the font and size that is being worked on.

Traditionally, these letters are shed as square boxes. The default box that we draw around is what the browser creates as a CSS box when a part or sentence of a post is completed, as in the example.

In the example above, the size of the box is equal to the size of the sentence, but we can change it by adding new words.

Separating the text with `padding` and `margin` produces block level elements for us. Placing the contents in different blocks is also a way to tag them in the HTML and CSS world with another markup, such as `p`, `heading`, `quote`. Each of these is a block. So we can work independently on each block without affecting the others.

In this way, placing a box pattern on the base of a group of letters gives us a chance to create a highly sophisticated layout.
