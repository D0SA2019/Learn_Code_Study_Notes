# Making Sense of the CSS Box Model
## 1.3. Entre The Origin of the Box in Typography
### 1.3.2 - Change the type and change the box
All fonts and all types have standard point size, line height, leading, tracking and kerning. They determine the relationship between letters, words, sentences and lines. Therefore, the size of our CSS boxes is also linked to them.

The ideal way to change a box is to change the type. Changing the font type and size also changes the size of the box. Larger fonts create larger boxes.

We can also change the tracking and spacing of the text. We do this with `letter-spacing` in CSS. Below you can see examples of different spacing values.

Tracking is often used in traditional typography to align text within a box. However, in the web world, the text alignment is organized in another particular, called `text-align`. For this reason, `letter-spacing` is also used for tracking in the digital world. Alignment is used for `text-align`. See examples below.

#### `text-align` = right
