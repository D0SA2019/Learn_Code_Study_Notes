# Making Sense of the CSS Box Model
## 1.3. Entre The Origin of the Box in Typography
### 1.3.3 - Text flow in the box
In traditional print typography, the size of the paper is fixed, and values such as the resolution pixel of the print machine do not change. When it changes, old designs are invalid and replaced with new ones. However, when viewing content in the digital world, we are faced with different resolutions and viewing options on multiple devices. Since there is no clear boundary for viewing dimensions, there is no limit to how content is arranged according to screens. Generally, such display arrangements are made through the Y-axis. We can fix the area to be used for each box and give the minimum and maximum values for height and width. When we provide a `width` value, specify the height of the box itself, but when determining a constant` height` value of the box can be out of the box, we may need to take additional measures for this.

Below you can see some examples.
