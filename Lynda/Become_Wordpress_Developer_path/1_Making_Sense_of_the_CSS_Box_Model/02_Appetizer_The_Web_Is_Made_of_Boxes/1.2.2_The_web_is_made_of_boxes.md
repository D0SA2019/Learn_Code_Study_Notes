Let's start with how a browser interprets the document. The above example code ignores parts marked with `<head>`, only the `<body>` tag looks at. Some sections of the document may be composed of articles, links, paragraphs, etc., such as `The Web is Made of Boxes` line. Some contents, such as images or videos, are not actually included in the document, but instead, display them from another source we refer to as a reference.

A page that appears as above is actually the following document. The browser receives this document and sets up the visual structure of the page by the information provided.

When we take a closer look at this document, which looks like plain text, we see that it consists of a group of labels and boxes of different components. Thus, the browser takes the rules, the parts that are written, and presents them to the visitor in a meaningful way.

The box model for the browser starts with a markup such as `<div>`, `<p>`, `<img>` or `<a>` and ends when the same markup is closed. So,  every label is a box.

To understand the logic of the boxes, just look at a plain HTML page with the browser's developer tools.
