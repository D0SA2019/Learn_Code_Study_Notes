# 1. Making Sense of the CSS Box Model
## 1.2. Appetizer The Web Is Made of Boxes
### 1.2.1 - Displaying information through the web
When we look at a website, we should be able to see more than photos, videos, and content. What we see is actually interpreting media elements by all browsers, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos, and visualized for us. A document is a data of pixels that look like a written text to us. A visual image appears as a photo for us, but in the software world is a combination of bright and dark and hue. The task of a web developer is to write a series of interpretation information to show the page visitors the most accessible way. This can mean a lot of things. Writing a proper markup, making responsive designs accessible on all screens, etc.

For example, in the above simple webpage, the developer passes the following information to the browser:

1. Write the given text in the upper left corner with the default font.
2. View the information.
3. View the image.
4. View the text using the available space.

We'll tell you how the browser will interpret these stages. In the Internet world, content and content presentation are two different things. The content is HTML, and the presentation is CSS. There is an unlimited way to visualize a content, and its basis is through the boxes.
