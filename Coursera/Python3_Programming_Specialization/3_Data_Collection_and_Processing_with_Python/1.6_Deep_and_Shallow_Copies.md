## Week 1 : Nested Data and Nested Iteration
### 1.6. Deep and Shallow Copies

Earlier when we discussed cloning and aliasing lists we had mentioned that simply cloning a list using `[:]` would take care of any issues with having two lists unintentionally connected to each other. That was definitely true for making shallow copies (copying a list at the highest level), but as we get into nested data, and nested lists in particular, the rules become a bit more complicated. We can have second-level aliasing in these cases, which means we need to make deep copies.

When you copy a nested list, you do not also get copies of the internal lists. This means that if you perform a mutation operation on one of the original sublists, the copied version will also change. We can see this happen in the following nested list, which only has two levels.


```python
original = [["dogs", "puppies"], ["cats", "kittens"]]
copied_version = original[:]
print(copied_version)
print(copied_version is original)
print(copied_version == original)

original[0].append(["canines"])
print(original)
print("----Now look at the copied version----")
print(copied_version)
```

**Output** :

```
[['dogs', 'puppies'], ['cats', 'kittens']]
False
True
[['dogs', 'puppies', ['canines']], ['cats', 'kittens']]
----Now look at the copied version----
[['dogs', 'puppies', ['canines']], ['cats', 'kittens']]
```

Assuming that you don’t want to have aliased lists inside of your nested list, then you’ll need to perform nested iteration.


```python
original = [["dogs", "puppies"], ["cats", "kittens"]]
copied_outer_list = []

for inner_list in original:
	copied_inner_list = []
	for item in inner_list:
		copied_inner_list.append(item)
	copied_outer_list.append(copied_inner_list)

print(copied_outer_list)

original[0].append(["canines"])
print(original)
print("----Now look at the copied version----")
print(copied_outer_list)
```

**Output** :

```
[['dogs', 'puppies'], ['cats', 'kittens']]
[['dogs', 'puppies', ['canines']], ['cats', 'kittens']]
----Now look at the copied version----
[['dogs', 'puppies'], ['cats', 'kittens']]
```

Or, equivalently, you could take advantage of the slice operator to do the copying of the inner list.


```python
original = [['dogs', 'puppies'], ['cats', "kittens"]]
copied_outer_list = []
for inner_list in original:
	copied_inner_list = inner_list[:]
	copied_outer_list.append(copied_inner_list)
print(copied_outer_list)

original[0].append(["canines"])
print(original)
print("----Now look at the copied version----")
print(copied_outer_list)
```

**Output** :

```
[['dogs', 'puppies'], ['cats', 'kittens']]
[['dogs', 'puppies', ['canines']], ['cats', 'kittens']]
----Now look at the copied version----
[['dogs', 'puppies'], ['cats', 'kittens']]
```

This process above works fine when there are only two layers or levels in a nested list. However, if we want to make a copy of a nested list that has more than two levels, then we recommend using the `copy` module. In the copy module there is a method called `deepcopy` that will take care of the operation for you.


```python
import copy
original = [['canines', ['dogs', 'puppies']], ['felines', ['cats', 'kittens']]]

shallow_copy_version = original[:]
deeply_copied_version = copy.deepcopy(original)

original.append("Hi there")
original[0].append(["marsupials"])

print("---- Original ----")
print(original)
print("---- Depp copy ----")
print(deeply_copied_version)
print("---- Shallow copy -----")
print(shallow_copy_version)
```

**Output** :

```
[['canines', ['dogs', 'puppies'], ['marsupials']], ['felines', ['cats', 'kittens']], 'Hi there']
---- Depp copy ----
[['canines', ['dogs', 'puppies']], ['felines', ['cats', 'kittens']]]
---- Shallow copy -----
[['canines', ['dogs', 'puppies'], ['marsupials']], ['felines', ['cats', 'kittens']]]
```
