### 3.6. Debugging Calls to `requests.get`

In a full python environment, you will not always get a Response object back from a call to `requests.get`. What you get back will generally be even more informative than what you get in the Runestone environment, but you have to know where to look.

The first thing that might go wrong is that you get a runtime error when you call `requests.get(dest_url)`. There are two possibilities for what’s gone wrong in that case.

One possibility is that the value provided for the `params` parameter is not a valid dictionary or doesn’t have key-value pairs that can be converted into text strings suitable for putting into a URL. For example, if you execute `requests.get("http://github.com", params = [0,1])`, [0,1] is a list rather than a dictionary and the python interpreter generates the error, `TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable`.

The second possibility is that the variable `dest_url` is either not bound to a string, or is bound to a string that isn’t a valid URL. For example, it might be bound to the string `"http://foo.bar/bat"`. foo.bar is not a valid domain name that can be resolved to an ip address, so there’s no server to contact. That will yield an error of type requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. Here’s a complete error message:

```
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='foo.bar', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /bat?key=val (Caused by <class 'socket.gaierror'>: [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed)
```

The best approach is to look at the URL that is produced, eyeball it, and plug it into a browser to see what happens. Unfortunately, if the call to `requests.get` produces an error, you won’t get a Response object, so you’ll need some other way to see what URL was produced. The function defined below takes the same parameters as `requests.get` and returns the URL as a string, without trying to fetch it.


```python
import requests

def requestURL(baseurl, params={}):
  # This function accepts a URL path and a params diction as inputs
  # It calls requests.get() with those inputs
  # and returns the full URL of the data you want to get
  req = requests.Request(method = "GET", url=baseurl, params = params)
  prepped = req.prepare()
  return prepped.url

print(requestURL(some_base_url, some_params_dictionary))
```

Assuming `requestURL()` returns a URL, match up what you see from the printout of the params dictionary to what you see in the URL that was printed out. If you have a sample of a URL from the API documentation, see if the structure of your URL matches what’s there. Perhaps you have misspelled one of the API parameter names or you misspelled the base url.

You can also try cutting and pasting the printed URL into a browser window, to see what error message you get from the website. You can then try changing the URL in the browser and reloading. When you finally get a url that works, you will need to translate the changes you made in the url back into changes to make to your baseurl or params dictionary.

If `requests.get()` executes without generating a runtime error, you are still not done with your error checking. No error means that your computer managed to connect to some web server and get some kind of response, but it doesn’t mean that it got the data you were hoping to get.

Fortunately, the response object returned by `requests.get()` has the .url attribute, which will help you with debugging. It’s a good practice during program development to have your program print it out. This is easier than calling `requestURL()` but is only available to you if `requests.get()` succeeds in returning a Response object.

More importantly, you’ll want to print out the contents. Sometimes the text that’s retrieved is an error message that you can read, such as `{"request empty": "There is no data that corresponds to your search."}`. In other cases, it’s just obviously the wrong data. Print out the first couple hundred characters of the response text to see if it makes sense.

```python
import requests
dest_url = <some expr>
d = <some dictionary>
resp = requests.get(dest_url, params=d)
print(resp.url)
print(resp.text[:200])
```

Now you try it. Use `requests.get()` and/or `requestURL()` to generate the following url, `https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=%22violins+and+guitars%22`. (Don’t look at the previous page of the textbook, at least not yet. If you can’t figure it out after 15 minutes of trying the approaches on this page, then look back.)


```python
dest_url = "https://www.google.com/search"
d = {"tbm": "isch", "q": "violins and guitars"}
resp = requests.get(dest_url, params=d)
print(resp.url)
print(resp.text[:200])
```

**Output** :

```
https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=violins+and+guitars

```python
dest_url = "https://www.google.com/search"
d = {"tbm": "isch", "q": '"violins and guitars"'}
resp = requests.get(dest_url, params=d)
print(resp.url)
print(resp.text[:200])
```

**Check Your Understanding**

**Q1** : If the results you are getting back from a call to `requests.get()` are not what you expected, what’s the first thing you should do?

A. look at the .url attribute of the Response object <br>
B. look at the first few characters of the .text attribute of the Response object ✅ <br>
C. look at the .status attribute of the response object <br>
D. look carefully at your code and compare it to the sample code here <br>

----

**Q2** : In a full python environment, if there is a runtime error and you don’t get a Response object back from the call to `requests.get()`, what should you do?

A. look at the .url attribute of the Response object <br>
B. look at the values you passed in to requests.get() <br>
C. invoke the requestURL() function with the same parameters you used to invoke requests.get() ✅  <br>
D. look carefully at your code and compare it to the sample code on this page <br>
