### 3.4. Generating URLs with `requests.get`


Fortunately, when you want to pass information as a URL parameter value, you don’t have to remember all the substitutions that are required to encode special characters. Instead, that capability is built into the requests module.

The `get` function in the requests module takes an optional parameter called `params`. If a value is specified for that parameter, it should be a dictionary. The keys and values in that dictionary are used to append something to the URL that is requested from the remote site.

For example, in the following, the base url is https://google.com/search. A dictionary with two parameters is passed. Thus, the whole url is that base url, plus a question mark, “?”, plus a “q=…” and a “tbm=…” separated by an “&”. In other words, the final url that is visited is https://www.google.com/search?q=%22violins+and+guitars%22&tbm=isch. Actually, because dictionary keys are unordered in python, the final url might sometimes have the encoded key-value pairs in the other order: https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=%22violins+and+guitars%22. Fortunately, most websites that accept URL parameters in this form will accept the key-value pairs in any order.

```python
d = {'q': '"violins and guitars"', 'tbm': 'isch'}
results = requests.get("https://google.com/search", params=d)
print(results.url)
```

**Output** :

```
https://www.google.com/search?q=%22violins+and+guitars%22&tbm=isch
```

Below are more examples of urls, outlining the base part of the url - which would be the first argument when calling `request.get()` - and the parameters - which would be written as a dictionary and passed into the params argument when calling `request.get()`.

Here’s an executable sample, using the optional params parameter of `requests.get`. It gets the same data from the datamus api that we saw previously. Here, however, the full url is built inside the call to `requests.get`; we can see what url was built by printing it out, on line 5.

```python
import requests

# page = requests.get("https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=funny")

kval_pairs = {"rel_rhy": "funny"}
page = requests.get("https://api.datamuse.com/words", params=kval_pairs)
print(page.text[:150])
print(page.url)
```

**Output** :

```
[{"word":"money","score":4477,"numSyllables":2},{"word":"honey","score":1228,"numSyllables":2},{"word":"sunny","score":737,"numSyllables":2},{"word":"
https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=funny
```

**Check Your Understanding**

**Q1** : How would you request the URL http://bar.com/goodstuff?greet=hi+there&frosted=no using the requests module?

A. requests.get("http://bar.com/goodstuff", '?", {'greet': 'hi there'}, '&', {'frosted':'no'})  <br>
B. requests.get("http://bar.com/", params = {'goodstuff':'?', 'greet':'hi there', 'frosted':'no'})  <br>
C. requests.get("http://bar.com/goodstuff", params = ['greet', 'hi', 'there', 'frosted', 'no'])  <br>
D. requests.get("http://bar.com/goodstuff", params = {'greet': 'hi there', 'frosted':'no'})  ✅ <br>

----

**Q2** : If `resp` is a Response object returned by a call to `requests.get()`, which of the following is a way to extract the contents into a python dictionary or list?

A. resp.json()   ✅ <br>
B. resp.json  <br>
C. json.dumps(resp.text)  <br>
D. json.loads(resp.text)  ✅ <br>
E. json.loads(resp.url)  <br>
