## Week 3 : Internet APIs
### 3.8. Searching for Media on iTunes

The iTunes API allows users to search for movies, podcasts, music, music videos, tv shows, and books that are hosted on the iTunes site. You can explore the official [iTunes API documentation](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/).

Earlier we showed a possible query for podcasts about Ann Arbor. Now, we’ll show you how to construct it yourself!

We will first need to write our import statements, so that we have access to the requests module and json module.


```python
import requests
import json
```


At this point, we look to our documentation to find out what the base of the url will be as well as what parameters are neeed to construct the request. In the Searching section of the documentation, we can see that the url should be in the form of `https://itunes.apple.com/search?parameterkeyvalue` so we know the base url should be `https://itunes.apple.com/search`. To determine what parameters are necessary, we can look at the table in the documentation to learn what parameter keys and values will be understood by the iTuens API server.

`term` is a required parameter with no default value, so we’ll have to provide that.

```python
import requests
import json

params = {"term": "Ann Arbor"}
```

We also want to make sure that we’re searching for podcasts.

```python
import requests
import json

params = {"entity": "podcast"}
# or
params = {"media": "podcast"}
```

Note that both **entity** and **media** are parameters we can use for this task. Entity can be more specific though, so you may need to use that in rather than media!

Now, our code can now make a request to the iTunes API. We’re using the request_with_caching module and providing a cached response to the query in the activecodes. You can try running different queries, but if the itunes webserver is inaccessible to you for one reason or another, it may not work.


```python
import requests
import json

parameters = {"term": "Ann Arbor", "entity": "podcast"}
iTunes_response = requests.get("https://itunes.apple.com/search", params=parameters)

py_data = json.loads(iTunes_response.text)
print(json.dumps(py_data, indent=2)[:500])
```

**Output** :

```
{
  "resultCount": 29,
  "results": [
    {
      "wrapperType": "track",
      "kind": "podcast",
      "collectionId": 1089272384,
      "trackId": 1089272384,
      "artistName": "Ann Arbor District Library",
      "collectionName": "Ann Arbor Stories | Ann Arbor District Library",
      "trackName": "Ann Arbor Stories | Ann Arbor District Library",
      "collectionCensoredName": "Ann Arbor Stories | Ann Arbor District Library",
      "trackCensoredName": "Ann Arbor Stories | Ann Arbor Distr
```

With that result in hand, you will have to go through the process previously described as Understand. Extract. Repeat. . For example, to print out the names of all the podcasts returned, one could run the following code.

```python
import requests
import json

parameters = {"term": "Ann Arbor", "entity": "podcast"}
iTunes_response = requests.get("https://itunes.apple.com/search", params=parameters)

py_data = json.loads(iTunes_response.text)

for r in py_data["results"]:
  print(r["trackName"])
```

**Output** :
