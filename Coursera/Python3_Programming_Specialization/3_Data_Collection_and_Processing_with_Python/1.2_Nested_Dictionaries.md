## Week 1 : Nested Data and Nested Iteration
### 1.2. Nested Dictionaries


Just as lists can contain items of any type, the value associated with a key in a dictionary can also be an object of any type. In particular, it is often useful to have a list or a dictionary as a value in a dictionary. And of course, those lists or dictionaries can also contain lists and dictionaries. There can be many layers of nesting.

Only the values in dictionaries can be objects of arbitrary type. The keys in dictionaries must be one of the immutable data types (numbers, strings, tuples).

**Check Your Understanding**

**Q1** : Which of the following is a legal assignment statement, after the following code executes?

```python
d = {'key1': {'a': 5, 'c': 90, 5: 50}, 'key2':{'b': 3, 'c': "yes"}}
```

A. `d[5] = {1: 2, 3: 4}`  âœ… <br>
B. `d[{1:2, 3:4}] = 5`  <br>
C. `d['key1']['d'] = d['key2']`  <br>
D. `d[key2] = 3`  <br>

**Q1** : Extract the value associated with the key color and assign it to the variable `color`. Do not hard code this.

```python
# Given
info = {'personal_data':
         {'name': 'Lauren',
          'age': 20,
          'major': 'Information Science',
          'physical_features':
             {'color': {'eye': 'blue',
                        'hair': 'brown'},
              'height': "5'8"}
         },
       'other':
         {'favorite_colors': ['purple', 'green', 'blue'],
          'interested_in': ['social media', 'intellectual property', 'copyright', 'music', 'books']
         }
      }


# Solution
color = info["personal_data"]["physical_features"]["color"]
print(color)
```

**Output** :

```
{'eye': 'blue', 'hair': 'brown'}
```
