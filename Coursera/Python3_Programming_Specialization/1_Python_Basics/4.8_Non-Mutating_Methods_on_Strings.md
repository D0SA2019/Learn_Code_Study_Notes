## Week 4 : Sequence Mutation and Accumulation Patterns
### 4.8. Non-Mutating Methods on Strings

There are a wide variety of methods for string objects. Try the following program.

```python
ss = "Hello, World"
print(ss.upper())

tt = ss.lower()
print(tt)
print(ss)
```

**Output** :

```
HELLO, WORLD
hello, world
Hello, World
```

In this example, `upper` is a method that can be invoked on any string object to create a new string in which all the characters are in uppercase. `lower` works in a similar fashion changing all characters in the string to lowercase. (The original string `ss` remains unchanged. A new string `tt` is created.)

You’ve already seen a few methods, such as `count` and `index`, that work with strings and are non-mutating. In addition to those and `upper` and `lower`, the following table provides a summary of some other useful string methods. There are a few activecode examples that follow so that you can try them out.


| Method | Parameters | Descriptiion |
|--|--|--|
| `upper` | none | Returns a string in all uppercase |
| `lower` | none | Returns a string in all lowercase |
| `count` | item | Returns the number of occurences of item |
| `index` | item | Returns the leftmost index where the substring item is found and causes a runtime error if item is not found|
| `strip` | none | Returns a string with the leading and trailing whitespace removed |
| `replace` | old, new | Replaces all occurrences of old substring with new |
| `format` | substitutions | Involved! See string format method, below |


You should experiment with these methods so that you understand what they do. Note once again that the methods that return strings do not change the original. You can also consult the [Python documentation for strings](http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

```python
ss = "     Hello, World     "

els = ss.count("l")
print(els)

print("***" + ss.strip() + "***")

news = ss.replace("o", "***")
print(news)
```

**Output** :

```
3
***Hello, World***
     Hell***, W***rld
```


```python
food = "banana bread"
print(food.upper())
```

**Output** :

```
BANANA BREAD
```
