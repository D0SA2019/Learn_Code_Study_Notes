## Week 3 : Booleans and Conditionals
### 3.2. Logical Operators

There are three logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`. The semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example, `x > 0 and x < 10` is true only if `x` is greater than 0 and at the same time, x is less than 10. How would you describe this in words? You would say that x is between 0 and 10, not including the endpoints.

`n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0` is true if either of the conditions is true, that is, if the number is divisible by 2 or divisible by 3. In this case, one, or the other, or both of the parts has to be true for the result to be true.

Finally, the `not` operator negates a boolean expression, so `not  x > y` is true if `x > y` is false, that is, if `x` is less than or equal to `y`.


```python
x = 5
print(x>0 and x<10)

n = 25
print(n%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0)
```


**Output** :

```
True
False
```


**Common Mistake!**

There is a very common mistake that occurs when programmers try to write boolean expressions. For example, what if we have a variable `number` and we want to check to see if its value is 5, 6, or 7? In words we might say: “number equal to 5 or 6 or 7”. However, if we translate this into Python, `number == 5 or 6 or 7`, it will not be correct. The `or` operator must join the results of three equality checks. The correct way to write this is `number == 5 or number == 6 or number == 7`.

This may seem like a lot of typing but it is absolutely necessary. You cannot take a shortcut.

Well, actually, you can take a shortcut but not that way. Later `in` this chapter you’ll learn about the in operator for strings and sequences: you could write `number in [5, 6, 7]`.

**Check Your Understanding**


**E1** : What is the correct Python expression for checking to see if a number stored in a variable x is between 0 and 5.

A. x > 0 and < 5 <br>
B. 0 < x < 5 <br>
C. x > 0 or x < 5 <br>
D. x > 0 and x < 5 ✅ <br>
