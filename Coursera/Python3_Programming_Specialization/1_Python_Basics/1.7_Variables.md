### 1.7. Variables

One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate **variables**. A variable is a name that refers to a value.

**Assignment statements** create new variables and also give them values to refer to.

```python
message = "What's up, Doc?"
n = 17
pi = 3.14159
```

This example makes three assignments. The first assigns the string value `"What's up, Doc?"` to a new variable named `message`. The second assigns the integer `17` to `n`, and the third assigns the floating-point number `3.14159` to a variable called `pi`.

The **assignment token**, =, should not be confused with equality (we will see later that equality uses the `==` token). The assignment statement links a name, on the left hand side of the operator, with a value, on the right hand side. This is why you will get an error if you enter:

```python
17 = n
```

**Tip** : When reading or writing code, say to yourself “n is assigned 17” or “n gets the value 17” or “n is a reference to the object 17” or “n refers to the object 17”. Don’t say “n equals 17”.

A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing to the variable’s value. This kind of figure, known as a **reference diagram**, is often called a **state snapshot** because it shows what state each of the variables is in at a particular instant in time. (Think of it as the variable’s state of mind). This diagram shows the result of executing the assignment statements shown above.

If your program includes a variable in any expression, whenever that expression is executed it will produce the value that is linked to the variable at the time of execution. In other words, evaluating a variable looks up its value.

```python
message = "What's up, Doc?"
n = 17
pi = 3.14159

print(message)
print(n)
print(pi)
```

**Output**:

```
What's up, Doc?
17
3.14159
```

We use variables in a program to “remember” things, like the current score at the football game. But variables are variable. This means they can change over time, just like the scoreboard at a football game. You can assign a value to a variable, and later assign a different value to the same variable.


**Note** : This is different from math. In algebra, if you give `x` the value 3, it cannot change to refer to a different value half-way through your calculations!

To see this, read and then run the following program. You’ll notice we change the value of `day` three times, and on the third assignment we even give it a value that is of a different type.

A great deal of programming is about having the computer remember things. For example, we might want to keep track of the number of missed calls on your phone. Each time another call is missed, we will arrange to update or change the variable so that it will always reflect the correct value.

Any place in a Python program where a number or string is expected, you can put a variable name instead. The python interpreter will substitute the value for the variable name.

For example, we can find out the data type of the current value of a variable by putting the variable name inside the parentheses following the function name `type`.

```python
message = "What's up, Doc?"
n = 17
pi = 3.14159

print(type(message))
print(type(n))
print(type(pi))
```

**Output**:

```
<class 'str'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
```

**Note** : If you have programmed in another language such as Java or C++, you may be used to the idea that variables have types that are declared when the variable name is first introduced in a program. Python doesn’t do that. Variables don’t have types in Python; values do. That means that it is acceptable in Python to have a variable name refer to an integer and later have the same variable name refer to a string. This is almost never a good idea, because it will confuse human readers (including you), but the Python interpreter will not complain.

#### Variable Names and Keywords

Variable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and digits, but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore. Although it is legal to use uppercase letters, by convention we don’t. If you do, remember that case matters. `Bruce` and `bruce` are different variables.

**Caution** : Variable names can never contain spaces.

The underscore character (`_`) can also appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as `my_name` or `price_of_tea_in_china`. There are some situations in which names beginning with an underscore have special meaning, so a safe rule for beginners is to start all names with a letter.

If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error. In the example below, each of the variable names is illegal.

```python
76trombones = "big parade"
more$ = 1000000
class = "Computer Science 101"
```

`76trombones` is illegal because it does not begin with a letter. `more$` is illegal because it contains an illegal character, the dollar sign. But what’s wrong with `class`?

It turns out that `class` is one of the Python keywords. Keywords define the language’s syntax rules and structure, and they cannot be used as variable names. Python has thirty-something keywords (and every now and again improvements to Python introduce or eliminate one or two):

| | | | | | |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| `and` | `as` | `assert` | `break` | `class` | `continue` |
| `def` | `del` | `elif` | `else` | `except` | `exec` |
| `finally` | `for` | `from` | `global` | `if` | `import` |
| `in` | `is` | `lambda` | `nonlocal` | `not` | `or` |
| `pass` | `raise` | `return` | `try` | `while` | `with` |
| `yield` | `True` | `False` | `None` | | |

You might want to keep this list handy. If the interpreter complains about one of your variable names and you don’t know why, see if it is on this list.


#### Choosing the Righ Variable Name
Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful to the human readers of the program — they help the programmer document, or remember, what the variable is used for. Beginning programmers sometimes think it is funny to use strange or obscene names for their variables. This is not good practice and will not amuse your professor. Get in the habit of using meaningful names right away.

**Caution**

Beginners sometimes confuse “meaningful to the human readers” with “meaningful to the computer”. So they’ll wrongly think that because they’ve called some variable `average` or `pi`, it will somehow automagically calculate an average, or automagically associate the variable pi with the value 3.14159. No! The computer doesn’t attach semantic meaning to your variable names.

So you’ll find some instructors who deliberately don’t choose meaningful names when they teach beginners — not because they don’t think it is a good habit, but because they’re trying to reinforce the message that you, the programmer, have to write some program code to calculate the average, or you must write an assignment statement to give a variable the value you want it to have.


#### Reassignment

As we have mentioned previously, it is legal to make more than one assignment to the same variable. A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new value (and stop referring to the old value).

```python
bruce = 5
print(bruce)

bruce = 7
print(bruce)
```

**Output**:

```
5
7
```

The first time `bruce` is printed, its value is 5, and the second time, its value is 7. The assignment statement changes the value (the object) that `bruce` refers to.

Here is what reassignment looks like in a reference diagram:

It is important to note that in mathematics, a statement of equality is always true. If `a is equal to b` now, then `a will always equal to b`. In Python, an assignment statement can make two variables refer to the same object and therefore have the same value. They appear to be equal. However, because of the possibility of reassignment, they don’t have to stay that way:

```python
a = 5
b = a
print(a, b)

a = 3
print(a, b)
```

**Output**:

```
5 5
3 5
```

Line 4 changes the value of `a` but does not change the value of `b`, so they are no longer equal. We will have much more to say about equality in a later chapter.

**Developing your mental model of How Python Evaluates**

Its important to start to develop a good mental model of the steps the Python interpreter takes when evaluating an assignment statement. In an assignment statement, the interpreter first evaluates the code on the right hand side of the assignment operator. It then gives a name to whatever that is.

**Note** : In some programming languages, a different symbol is used for assignment, such as `<-` or `:=`. The intent is that this will help to avoid confusion. Python chose to use the tokens `=` for assignment, and `==` for equality. This is a popular choice also found in languages like C, C++, Java, and C#.
