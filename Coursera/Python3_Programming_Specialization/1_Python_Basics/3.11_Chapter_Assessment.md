#### Assessments

**A1**. `rainfall_mi` is a string that contains the average number of inches of rainfall in Michigan for every month (in inches) with every month separated by a comma. Write code to compute the number of months that have more than 3 inches of rainfall. Store the result in the variable `num_rainy_months`. In other words, count the number of items with values `> 3.0.`

Hard-coded answers will receive no credit.


```python
# Given
rainfall_mi = "1.65, 1.46, 2.05, 3.03, 3.35, 3.46, 2.83, 3.23, 3.5, 2.52, 2.8, 1.85"


# Solution
rainfall_mi = "1.65, 1.46, 2.05, 3.03, 3.35, 3.46, 2.83, 3.23, 3.5, 2.52, 2.8, 1.85"
rains = rainfall_mi.split(",")
num_rainy_months = 0
for rain in rains:
    if float(rain) > 3.0 :
        num_rainy_months += 1

print(num_rainy_months)
```


**Output** :

```
5
```


-----

**A2**. The variable `sentence` stores a string. Write code to determine how many words in `sentence` start and end with the same letter, including one-letter words. Store the result in the variable `same_letter_count`.

Hard-coded answers will receive no credit.


```python
# Given
sentence = "students flock to the arb for a variety of outdoor activities such as jogging and picnicking"


# Solution
sentence = "students flock to the arb for a variety of outdoor activities such as jogging and picnicking"
sliced = sentence.split()
same_letter_count = 0

for word in sliced:
	if word[0] == word[-1]:
		same_letter_count += 1

print(same_letter_count)
```


**Output** :

```
2
```


-----

**A3**. Write code to count the number of strings in list `items` that have the character w in it. Assign that number to the variable `acc_num`.

HINT 1: Use the accumulation pattern!

HINT 2: the in operator checks whether a substring is present in a string.

Hard-coded answers will receive no credit.

```python
# Given
items = ["whirring", "wow!", "calendar", "wry", "glass", "", "llama","tumultuous","owing"]


# Solution
items = ["whirring", "wow!", "calendar", "wry", "glass", "", "llama","tumultuous","owing"]
acc_num = 0

for item in items:
	w_num = item.count("w")
	if w_num > 0:
		acc_num +=1
print(acc_num)
```


**Output** :

```
4
```



-----

**A4**. Write code that counts the number of words in `sentence` that contain either an “a” or an “e”. Store the result in the variable `num_a_or_e`.

Note 1: be sure to not double-count words that contain both an a and an e.

HINT 1: Use the `in` operator.

HINT 2: You can either use `or` or `elif`.

Hard-coded answers will receive no credit.


```python
# Given
sentence = "python is a high level general purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems."



# Solution
sentence = "python is a high level general purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems."
sliced = sentence.split()
num_a_or_e = 0

for word in sliced:
    num_a = word.count("a")
    num_e = word.count("e")

    if num_a > 0 or num_e > 0:
        num_a_or_e += 1

print(num_a_or_e)
```

**Output** :

```
14
```


-----

**A5**. Write code that will count the number of vowels in the sentence `s` and assign the result to the variable `num_vowels`. For this problem, vowels are only a, e, i, o, and u.
Hint: use the `in` operator with `vowels`.


```python
# Given
s = "singing in the rain and playing in the rain are two entirely different situations but both can be fun"
vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u']


# Solution
s = "singing in the rain and playing in the rain are two entirely different situations but both can be fun"
vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u']

num_vowels = 0
sliced = s.split()

for word in sliced:
    for letter in word:
        if letter in vowels:
            num_vowels += 1

print(num_vowels)
```

**Output** :

```
32
```


-----

**A6**. Create one conditional so that if “Friendly” is in `w`, then “Friendly is here!” should be assigned to the variable `wrd`. If it’s not, check if “Friend” is in `w`. If so, the string “Friend is here!” should be assigned to the variable `wrd`, otherwise “No variation of friend is in here.” should be assigned to the variable `wrd`. (Also consider: does the order of your conditional statements matter for this problem? Why?)


```python
# Given
w = "Friendship is a wonderful human experience!"



# Solution
w = "Friendship is a wonderful human experience!"

if "Friendly" in w:
    wrd = "Friendly is here!"

elif "Friend" in w:
    wrd = "Friend is here!"
else:
    wrd = "No variation of friend is in here."
print(wrd)
```


**Output** :

```
Friend is here!
```


-----

**A7**. We have written conditionals for you to use. Create the variable `x` and assign it some integer so that at the end of the code, `output` will be assigned the string `"Consistently working"`.


```python
# Given
if x >= 10:
    output = "working"
else:
    output = "Still working"
if x > 12:
    output = "Always working"
elif x < 7:
    output = "Forever working"
else:
    output = "Consistently working"



# Solution
x = 9
```

-----

**A8**. Write code so that if `"STATS 250"` is in the list `schedule`, then the string `"You could be in Information Science!"` is assigned to the variable `resp`. Otherwise, the string `"That's too bad."` should be assigned to the variable `resp`.


```python
# Given
schedule = ["SI 106", "STATS 250", "SI 110", "ENGLISH 124/125"]


# Solution
schedule = ["SI 106", "STATS 250", "SI 110", "ENGLISH 124/125"]
if "STATS 250" in schedule:
    resp = "You could be in Information Science!"
else:
    resp = "That's too bad."

print(resp)
```

**Output** :

```
You could be in Information Science!
```


-----

**A9**. Create the variable `z` whose value is `30`. Write code to see if `z` is greater than `y`. If so, add 5 to `y`’s value, otherwise do nothing. Then, multiply `z` and `y`, and assign the resulting value to the variable `x`.


```python
# Given
y = 22



# Solution
y = 22
z = 30

if z > y:
    y += 5

x = z * y
print(x)
```

**Output** :

```
810
```

-----

**A10**. For each string in `wrd_lst`, find the number of characters in the string. If the number of characters is less than 6, add 1 to `accum` so that in the end, `accum` will contain an integer representing the total number of words in the list that have fewer than 6 characters.


```python
# Given
wrd_lst = ["Hello", "activecode", "Java", "C#", "Python", "HTML and CSS", "Javascript", "Swift", "php"]



# Solution
wrd_lst = ["Hello", "activecode", "Java", "C#", "Python", "HTML and CSS", "Javascript", "Swift", "php"]
accum = 0

for word in wrd_lst:
    len_word = len(word)

    if len_word < 6:
        accum += 1

print(accum)
```


**Output** :

```
5
```

#### Exercises

**Q1**. Write code that asks the user to enter a numeric score (0-100). In response, it should print out the score and corresponding letter grade, according to the table below.

| Score | Grade |
|--|--|
| >= 90 | A |
| [80-90]| B |
| [70-80]| C |
| [60-70]| D |
| < 60 | F |

The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals. A closed interval includes the number, and open interval excludes it. So 79.99999 gets grade C , but 80 gets grade B.

```python
score = int(input("Enter the score: "))

if score >= 90:
	grade = "A"
elif 80 <= score < 90:
	grade = "B"
elif 70 <= score < 80:
	grade = "C"
elif 60 <= score < 70:
	grade = "D"
else:
	grade = "F"

print(grade)
```

**Output** :

```
Enter the score: 80
B
```

**Q2**. A year is a **leap year** if it is divisible by 4. If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless the year is **also** evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year. Write code that asks the user to input a year and output True if it’s a leap year, or False otherwise. Use if statements.

| Year | Leap? |
|--|--|
| 1944 | True |
| 2011 | False |
| 1986 | False |
| 1800 | False |
| 1900 | False |
| 2000 | True |
| 2056 | True |

Above are some examples of what the output should be for various inputs.

```python
year = int(input("Enter the year: "))

if year % 100 == 0:
	if year % 400 == 0:
		is_leap = True
	else:
		is_leap = False
elif year % 4 == 0:
	is_leap = True
else:
	is_leap = False

print(is_leap)
```

----

**Q3**. What do these expressions evaluate to?

1. `3 == 3`
2. `3 != 3`
3. `3 >= 4`
4. `not (3 < 4)`

```python
print(3 == 3)
print(3 != 3)
print(3 >= 4)
print(not (3 < 4))
```

**Output** :

```
True
False
False
False
```

----


**Q4**. Give the **logical opposites** of these conditions, meaning an expression that would produce `False` whenever this expression produces `True`, and vice versa. You are not allowed to use the not operator.

1. `a > b`
2. `a >= b`
3. `a >= 18  and  day == 3`
4. `a >= 18  or  day != 3`


```
a < b
a < b
a < 18 and day != 3
a < 18 or day == 3
```


----

**Q5**. Provided are the lengths of two sides of a right-angled triangle. Assign the length of the hypotenuse the the variable `hypo_len`. (Hint: `x ** 0.5` will return the square root, or use `sqrt` from the math module)


```python
# Given
side1 = 3
side2 = 4


# Solution
hypo_len = ((side1 ** 2 ) * (side2 ** 2)) ** 0.5
print(hypo_len)
```

**Output** :

```
5.0
```

----

**Q6**. Provided is a list of numbers. For each of the numbers in the list, determine whether they are even. If the number is even, add `True` to a new list called `is_even`. If the number is odd, then add `False`.


```python
# Given
num_lst = [3, 20, -1, 9, 10]


# Solution
is_even = list()

for num in num_lst:
    if num % 2 == 0 :
        num_even = True
        is_even.append(num_even)
    else:
        num_even = False
        is_even.append(num_even)

print(is_even)
```

**Output** :

```
[False, True, False, False, True]
```

----


**Q7**. Provided is a list of numbers. For each of the numbers in the list, determine whether they are odd. If the number is odd, add `True` to a new list called `is_odd`. If the number is even, then add `False`.


```python
# Given
num_lst = [3, 20, -1, 9, 10]


# Solution
is_odd = list()

for num in num_lst:
	if num % 2 != 0:
		num_odd = True
		is_odd.append(num_odd)
	else:
		num_odd = False
		is_odd.append(num_odd)

print(is_odd)
```

**Output** :

```
[True, False, True, True, False]
```

----


**Q8**. Given the lengths of three sides of a triange, determine whether the triangle is right angled. If it is, the assign `True` to the variable `is_rightangled`. If it’s not, then assign `False` to the variable `is_rightangled`.

Hint: floating point arithmetic is not always exactly accurate, so it is not safe to test floating point numbers for equality. If a good programmer wants to know whether `x` is equal or close enough to `y`, they would probably code it up as

```python
if  abs(x - y) < 0.001:      # if x is approximately equal to y
    ...
```

```python
# Given
a = 5
b = 6
c = 8


# Solution
if (((b**2) + (c**2)) ** 0,5) == a:
	is_rightangled = True
elif (((a**2) + (c**2)) ** 0,5) == b:
	is_rightangled = True
elif (((a**2) + (b**2)) ** 0,5) == c:
	is_rightangled = True
else:
	is_rightangled = False

print(is_rightangled)
```

**Output** :

```
False
```

**Q9**. Implement the calculator for the date of Easter.

The following algorithm computes the date for Easter Sunday for any year between 1900 to 2099.

Ask the user to enter a year. Compute the following:

1. a = year % 19
2. b = year % 4
3. c = year % 7
4. d = (19 * a + 24) % 30
5. e = (2 * b + 4 * c + 6 * d + 5) % 7
6. dateofeaster = 22 + d + e

Special note: The algorithm can give a date in April. You will know that the date is in April if the calculation gives you an answer greater than 31. (You’ll need to adjust) Also, if the year is one of four special years (1954, 1981, 2049, or 2076) then subtract 7 from the date.

Your program should print an error message if the user provides a date that is out of range.


```python
year = int(input("Enter the year between 1900-2099: "))

if year not in list(range(1900, 2100)):
	print("The year isnt'n between 1900-2099")
else:
	a = year % 19
	b = year % 4
	c = year % 7
	d = (19 * a + 24) % 30
	e = (2 * b + 4 * c + 6 * d + 5) % 7
	dateofeaster = 22 + d + e

	if year in [1954, 1981, 2049, 2076]:
		dateofeaster -= 7
	if dateofeaster > 31:
		print("April", dateofeaster - 31)
	else:
		print("March", dateofeaster)
```

**Output** :

```
Enter the year between 1900-2099: 1957
April 21
```

----


**Q10**. Get the user to enter some text and print out True if it’s a palindrome, False otherwise. (Hint: reuse some of your code from the last question. The == operator compares two values to see if they are the same)


```python
text = input("Enter a word or text: ")
count = 0

for char in text:
	ind = text.find(char)
	if char == text[(-ind)-1]:
		count += 1

if count >= 2:
	is_pal = True
else :
	is_pal = False

print(is_pal)
```

**Output** :

```
Enter a word or text: Red rum, sir, is murder
True
```

----

**Q11**. Write a program that will print out a greeting to each student in the list. This list should also keep track of how many students have been greeted and note that each time a new student has been greeted. When only one student has entered, the program should say "The first student has entered!". Afterwards, the program should say "There are {number here} students in the classroom!".
