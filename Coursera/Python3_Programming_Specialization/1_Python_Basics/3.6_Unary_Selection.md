## Week 3 : Booleans and Conditionals
### 3.6. Unary Selection

Another form of the `if` statement is one in which the `else` clause is omitted entirely. This creates what is sometimes called **unary selection**. In this case, when the condition evaluates to `True`, the statements are executed. Otherwise the flow of execution continues to the statement after the body of the `if`.

Flowchart of an if with no else :

```python
x = 10
if x < 0:
	print("The negative number ", x, " is not valid here.")
print("This is always printed.")
```

**Output** :

```
This is always printed.
```

What would be printed if the value of x is negative?

```python
x = -10
if x < 0:
	print("The negative number ", x, " is not valid here.")
print("This is always printed.")
```

**Output** :

```
The negative number  -10  is not valid here.
This is always printed.
```

**Check Your Understanding**

**E1** : What does the following code print?

```python
x = -10
if x < 0:
	print("The negative number ", x, " is not valid here.")
print("This is always printed.")
```

```
a.
This is always printed

b.
The negative number -10 is not valid here
This is always printed

c.
The negative number -10 is not valid here
```

A. Output a <br>
B. Output b ✅ <br>
C. Output c <br>
D. It will cause an error because every if must have an else clause. <br>

**E2** : Will the following code cause an error?

```python
x = -10
if x < 0:
	print("The negative number ", x, " is not valid here.")
else:
	print(x, " is a positive number")
else:
	print("This is always printed")
```


A. No <br>
B. Yes ✅ <br>
