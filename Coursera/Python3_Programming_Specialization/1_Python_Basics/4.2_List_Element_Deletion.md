## Week 4 : Sequence Mutation and Accumulation Patterns
### 4.2. List Element Deletion

Using slices to delete list elements can be awkward and therefore error-prone. Python provides an alternative that is more readable. The `del` statement removes an element from a list by using its position.

```python
a = ["one", "two", "three"]
del a[1]
print(a)

alist = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "d", "f"]
del alist[1:5]
print(alist)
```


**Output** :

```
['one', 'three']
['a', 'f']
```

As you might expect, `del` handles negative indices and causes a runtime error if the index is out of range. In addition, you can use a slice as an index for `del`. As usual, slices select all the elements up to, but not including, the second index.
