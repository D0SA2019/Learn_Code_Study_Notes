#### Assessments

**A1**. Write one for loop to print out each character of the string my_str on a separate line.


```python
# Given
my_str = "MICHIGAN"


# Solution
my_str = "MICHIGAN"
for char in my_str:
	print(char)
```

**Output** :

```
M
I
C
H
I
G
A
N
```

-----

**A2**. Write one for loop to print out each element of the list `several_things`. Then, write another for loop to print out the TYPE of each element of the list `several_things`. To complete this problem you should have written two different for loops, each of which iterates over the list `several_things`, but each of those 2 for loops should have a different result.


```python
# Given
several_things = ["hello", 2, 4, 6.0, 7.5, 234352354, "the end", "", 99]

# Solution
several_things = ["hello", 2, 4, 6.0, 7.5, 234352354, "the end", "", 99]

for item in several_things:
	print(item)

for item_type in several_things:
	print(type(item_type))
```

**Output** :

```
hello
2
4
6.0
7.5
234352354
the end

99
<class 'str'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'int'>
```


-----

**A3**. Write code that uses iteration to print out the length of each element of the list stored in `str_list`.


```python
# Given
str_list = ["hello", "", "goodbye", "wonderful", "I love Python"]


# Solution
str_list = ["hello", "", "goodbye", "wonderful", "I love Python"]

for item in str_list:
	print(len(item))

```

**Output** :

```
5
0
7
9
13
```



-----

**A4**. Write a program that uses the turtle module and a for loop to draw something. It doesn’t have to be complicated, but draw something different than we have done in the past. (Hint: if you are drawing something complicated, it could get tedious to watch it draw over and over. Try setting `.speed(10)` for the turtle to draw fast, or `.speed(0)` for it to draw super fast with no animation.)


```python
import turtle
import random

sc = turtle.Screen()
steve = turtle.Turtle()
steve.pensize(4)
steve.speed(2)

for line in range(random.randrange(1, 15)):
	steve.left(random.randrange(10, 360, 10))
	steve.forward(random.randrange(5, 150))

sc.exitonclick()
```

-----

**A5**. Write code to count the number of characters in `original_str` using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable `num_chars`. Do NOT use the `len` function to solve the problem (if you use it while you are working on this problem, comment it out afterward!)


```python
# Given
original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox."


# Solution
original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox."
num_chars = 0

for char in original_str:
	num_chars += 1

print(num_chars)
```

**Output** :

```
57
```

-----

**A6**. `addition_str` is a string with a list of numbers separated by the `+` sign. Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to take the sum of all of the numbers and assigns it to `sum_val` (an integer). (You should use the `.split("+")` function to split by `"+"` and `int()` to cast to an integer).


```python
# Given
addition_str = "2+5+10+20"


# Solution
addition_str = "2+5+10+20"

sliced = addition_str.split("+")
sum_val = 0

for number in sliced:
	sum_val += int(number)

print(sum_val)
```

**Output** :

```
37
```


-----

**A7**.  `week_temps_f` is a string with a list of fahrenheit temperatures separated by the `,` sign. Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to compute the **average** (sum divided by number of items) and assigns it to `avg_temp`. Do not hard code your answer (i.e., make your code compute both the sum or the number of items in `week_temps_f`) (You should use the `.split(","`) function to split by `","` and `float()` to cast to a float).


```python
# Given
week_temps_f = "75.1,77.7,83.2,82.5,81.0,79.5,85.7"


# Solution
week_temps_f = "75.1,77.7,83.2,82.5,81.0,79.5,85.7"

temps = week_temps_f.split(",")
len_temps = len(temps)
sum_temps = 0
avg_temp = 0

for temp in temps:
	sum_temps += float(temp)

avg_temp = sum_temps / len_temps
print(avg_temp)
```

**Output** :

```
80.67142857142858
```


-----

**A8**.  Write code to create a list of numbers from 0 to 67 and assign that list to the variable `nums`. Do not hard code the list.


```python
nums = list(range(68))
print(nums)
```

**Output** :

```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]
```

#### Exercises

**Q1**. In Robert McCloskey’s book Make Way for Ducklings, the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. This loop tries to output these names in order.

Of course, that’s not quite right because Ouack and Quack are misspelled. Can you fix it?

```python
# Given
prefixes = "JKLMNOPQ"
suffix = "ack"

for p in prefixes:
    print(p + suffix)


# Solution
prefixes = "JKLMNOPQ"
suffix = "ack"

for p in prefixes:
    if p == "O" or p == "Q":
        print(p + "u" + suffix)
    else:
        print(p + suffix)
```

**Output**:

```
Jack
Kack
Lack
Mack
Nack
Ouack
Pack
Quack
```

**Q2**. Get the user to enter some text and print it out in reverse order.

```python  
text = input("Enter a word or sentence: ")
rev = ""
for char in text[::-1]:
    rev += char
print(rev)
```

**Output**:

```
Enter a word or sentence: I don't know what's goin on!
!no niog s'tahw wonk t'nod I
```

**Q3**. Write a program that uses a for loop to print

```
One of the months of the year is January
One of the months of the year is February
One of the months of the year is March
```

etc...

```python
months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]

for month in months:
  print("One of the months of the year is", month)
```

**Output**:

```
One of the months of the year is January
One of the months of the year is February
One of the months of the year is March
One of the months of the year is April
One of the months of the year is May
One of the months of the year is June
One of the months of the year is July
One of the months of the year is August
One of the months of the year is September
One of the months of the year is October
One of the months of the year is November
One of the months of the year is December
```

**Q4**. Assume you have a list of numbers `12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20`

* Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line.
* Write a loop that prints each number and its square on a new line.


```python
numbers = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]

for number in numbers:
  print(number)

for number in numbers:
  print(number ** 2)
```

**Output**:

```
12
10
32
3
66
17
42
99
20
144
100

**Q5**. Write a program that asks the user for the number of sides, the length of the side, the color, and the fill color of a regular polygon. The program should draw the polygon and then fill it in.


```python
import turtle
sc = turtle.Screen()
steve = turtle.Turtle()
steve.speed(1)
steve.pensize(5)

sides = int(input("Enter the number of sides: "))
len_sides = int(input("Enter the lenght of the sides: "))
color = steve.color(input("Enter a color name: "))

steve.begin_fill()
for line in range(sides):
	steve.forward(len_sides)
	steve.left(72)
steve.end_fill()

sc.exitonclick()
```

**User Inputs**:

```
Enter the number of sides: 5
Enter the lenght of the sides: 100
Enter a color name: red
```

**Output**:

**Q6**. A drunk pirate makes a random turn and then takes 100 steps forward, makes another random turn, takes another 100 steps, turns another random amount, etc. A social science student records the angle of each turn before the next 100 steps are taken. Her experimental data is `160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86`. (Positive angles are counter-clockwise.) Use a turtle to draw the path taken by our drunk friend. After the pirate is done walking, print the current heading. Assume that the turtle originally has a heading of 0 and accumulate the changes in heading to print out the final. Your solution should work for any sequence of experimental data.


```python
import turtle
sc = turtle.Screen()
prite = turtle.Turtle()
prite.speed(1)
prite.pensize(3)

angles = [160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86]
head = 0

for angle in angles:
  prite.left(angle)
  prite.forward(100)
  head = (head + angle) % 360

print(head)

sc.exitonclick()
```
