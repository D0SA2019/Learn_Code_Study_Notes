### 2.7. Split and Join

#### `.split()`

Two of the most useful methods on strings involve lists of strings. The `split` method breaks a string into a list of words. By default, any number of whitespace characters is considered a word boundary.

```python
song = "The rain in Spain..."
wds = song.split()
print(wds)
```

**Output** :

```
["The", "rain", "in", "Spain..."]
```

An optional argument called a **delimiter** can be used to specify which characters to use as word boundaries.

The following example uses the string `ai` as the delimiter:

```python
song = "The rain in Spain..."
wds = song.split("ai")
print(wds)
```

**Output** :

```
['The r', 'n in Sp', 'n...']
```

Notice that the delimiter doesnâ€™t appear in the result.

#### `.join()`

The inverse of the `split` method is `join`. You choose a desired **separator** string, (often called the *glue*) and join the list with the glue between each of the elements.

```python
wds = ["red", "blue", "green"]
glue = ";"
s = glue.join(wds)
print(s)
print(wds)

print("***".join(wds))
print("".join(wds))
```

**Output** :

```
red;blue;green
["red", "blue", "green"]
red***blue***green
redbluegreen
```

The list that you glue together (`wds` in this example) is not modified. Also, you can use empty glue or multi-character strings as glue.

**Check your understanding**

**E1** : Create a new list of the 6th through 13th elements of `lst` (eight items in all) and assign it to the variable `output`.

```python
lst = ["swimming", 2, "water bottle", 44, "lollipop", "shine", "marsh", "winter", "donkey", "rain", ["Rio", "Beijing", "London"], [1,2,3], "gold", "bronze", "silver", "mathematician", "scientist", "actor", "actress", "win", "cell phone", "leg", "running", "horse", "socket", "plug", ["Phelps", "le Clos", "Lochte"], "drink", 22, "happyfeet", "penguins"]
```

**Solution** :

```python
lst = ["swimming", 2, "water bottle", 44, "lollipop", "shine", "marsh", "winter", "donkey", "rain", ["Rio", "Beijing", "London"], [1,2,3], "gold", "bronze", "silver", "mathematician", "scientist", "actor", "actress", "win", "cell phone", "leg", "running", "horse", "socket", "plug", ["Phelps", "le Clos", "Lochte"], "drink", 22, "happyfeet", "penguins"]

output = lst[5:13]
print(output)
```

**Output** :

```
['shine', 'marsh', 'winter', 'donkey', 'rain', ['Rio', 'Beijing', 'London'], [1, 2, 3], 'gold']
```

**E2** : Create a variable `output` and assign it to a list whose elements are the words in the string `str1`.



```python
str1 = "OH THE PLACES YOU'LL GO"
```

**Solution** :

```python
str1 = "OH THE PLACES YOU'LL GO"
output = str1.split()
print(output)
```

**Output** :

```
['OH', 'THE', 'PLACES', "YOU'LL", 'GO']
```
