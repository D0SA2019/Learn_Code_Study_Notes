## Week 2 : Sequences and Iteration
### 2.2. The Index Operator

The **indexing operator** (Python uses square brackets to enclose the index) selects a single character from a string. The characters are accessed by their position or index value. For example, in the string shown below, the 14 characters are indexed left to right from postion 0 to position 13.

It is also the case that the positions are named from right to left using negative numbers where -1 is the rightmost index and so on. Note that the character at index 6 (or -8) is the blank character.

```python
school = "Luther College"
m = school[2]
print(m)

lastchar = school[-1]
print(lastchar)
```

**Output** :

```
t
e
```

The expression `school[2]` selects the character at index 2 from `school`, and creates a new string containing just this one character. The variable m refers to the result.

The letter at index zero of `"Luther College"` is `L`. So at position `[2]` we have the letter t.

If you want the zero-eth letter of a string, you just put 0, or any expression with the value 0, in the brackets. Give it a try.

The expression in brackets is called an **index**. An index specifies a member of an ordered collection. In this case the collection of characters in the string. The index indicates which character you want. It can be any integer expression so long as it evaluates to a valid index value.

Note that indexing returns a string — Python has no special type for a single character. It is just a string of length 1.


**Index Operator: Accessing Elements of a List or Tuple**

The syntax for accessing the elements of a list or tuple is the same as the syntax for accessing the characters of a string. We use the index operator ( `[]` – not to be confused with an empty list). The expression inside the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the indices start at 0. Any integer expression can be used as an index and as with strings, negative index values will locate items from the right instead of from the left.

When we say the first, third or nth character of a sequence, we generally mean counting the usual way, starting with 1. The nth character and the character AT INDEX n are different then: The nth character is at index n-1. Make sure you are clear on what you mean!

Try to predict what will be printed out by the following code, and then run it to check your prediction. (Actually, it’s a good idea to always do that with the code examples. You will learn much more if you force yourself to make a prediction before you see the output.)

```python
numbers = [17, 123, 87, 34, 66, 8398, 44]
print(numbers[2])
print(numbers[9-8])
print(numbers[-2])
```

**Output** :

```
87
123
8398
```


```python
prices = [1.99, 2.00, 5.50, 20.95, 100.98]
print(prices[0])
print(prices[-1])
print(prices[3-5])
```

**Output** :

```
1.99
100.98
20.95
```

#### Disambiguation : []: creation vs indexing
Square brackets `[]` are used in quite a few ways in python. When you’re first learning how to use them it may be confusing, but with practice and repetition they’ll be easy to incorporate!

You have currently encountered two instances where we have used square brakets. The first is creating lists and the second is indexing. At first glance, creating and indexing are difficult to distinguish. However, indexing requires referencing an already created list while simply creating a list does not.

```python
new_lst = []
```

In the code above, a new list is created using the empty brackets. Since there’s nothing in it though, we can’t index into it.

```python
new_lst = ["NFLX", "AMZN", "GOOGL", "DIS", "XOM"]
part_of_new_lst = new_lst[0]
print(part_of_new_lst)
```

**Output** :

```
NFLX
```

In the code above, you’ll see how, now that we have elements inside of `new_lst`, we can index into it. In order to extract an element of the list, we do use `[]`, but we first have to specify which list we are indexing. Imagine if there was another list in the activecode. How would python know which list we want to index into if we don’t tell it? Additionally, we have to specify what element we want to extract. This belongs inside of the brakets.

Though it may be easier to distinguish in this above activecode, below may be a bit more difficult.

```python
lst = [0]
n_lst = lst[0]

print(lst)
print(n_lst)
```

**Output** :

```
[0]
0
```

Here, we see a list called `lst` being assigned to a list with one element, zero. Then, we see how `n_lst` is assigned the value associated with the first element of lst. Dispite the variable names, only one of the above variables is assigned to a list. Note that in this example, what sets creating appart from indexing is the reference to the list to let python know that you are extracting an element from another list.

**E6** : Assign the value of the last chacter of `lst` to the variable `output`. Do this so that the length of lst doesn’t matter.

```python
lst = "Every chess or checkers game begins from the same position and has a finite number of moves that can be played. While the number of possible scenarios and moves is quite large, it is still possible for computers to calculate that number and even be programmed to respond well against a human player..."
```


***Solution***:

```python
lst = "Every chess or checkers game begins from the same position and has a finite number of moves that can be played. While the number of possible scenarios and moves is quite large, it is still possible for computers to calculate that number and even be programmed to respond well against a human player..."
output = lst[-1]
print(output)
```

**E7** : Which of the following correctly uses indexing? Assume that a is a list or string. Select as many as apply.

A. w = [a] <br>
B. y = a[] <br>
C. x = [8] <br>
D. t = a[0] ✅ <br>


---

**Note**

Why does counting start at 0 going from left to right, but at -1 going from right to left? Well, indexing starting at 0 has a long history in computer science having to do with some low-level implementation details that we won’t go into. For indexing from right to left, it might seem natural to do the analgous thing and start at -0. Unfortunately, -0 is the same as 0, so s[-0] can’t be the last item. Remember we said that programming languages are formal languages where details matter and everything is taken literally?
