### 1.13. Our First Turtle Program
There are many modules in Python that provide very powerful features that we can use in our own programs. Some of these can send email or fetch web pages. Others allow us to perform complex mathematical calculations. In this chapter we will introduce a module that allows us to create a data object called a turtle that can be used to draw pictures.

Turtle graphics, as it is known, is based on a very simple metaphor. Imagine that you have a turtle that understands English. You can tell your turtle to do simple commands such as go forward and turn right. As the turtle moves around, if its tail is down touching the ground, it will draw a line (leave a trail behind) as it moves. If you tell your turtle to lift up its tail it can still move around but will not leave a trail. As you will see, you can make some pretty amazing drawings with this simple capability.

**Note** : The turtles are fun because they allow us to visualize what our code is doing, but the real purpose of the chapter is to teach ourselves a little more Python and to develop our theme of computational thinking. You’ll first draw simple geometric shapes with the turtles, and then we’ll summarize the concepts and syntax you’ve learned, in particular, classes, instances, and method invocations. These concepts are the building blocks of object-oriented programming, a paradigm for structuring a program that is widespread in every modern programming language.


Let’s try a couple of lines of Python code to create a new turtle and start drawing a simple figure like a rectangle. We will refer to our first turtle using the variable name alex, but remember that you can choose any name you wish as long as you follow the naming rules from the previous chapter.

The program as shown will only draw the first two sides of the rectangle. After line 4 you will have a straight line going from the center of the drawing canvas towards the right. After line 6, you will have a canvas with a turtle and a half drawn rectangle.

```python
import turtle             # allows us to use the turtles library
wn = turtle.Screen()      # creates a graphics window
alex = turtle.Turtle()    # create a turtle named alex
alex.forward(150)         # tell alex to move forward by 150 units
alex.left(90)             # turn by 90 degrees
alex.forward(75)          # complete the second side of a rectangle
```

**Output** :

Here are a couple of things you’ll need to understand about this program.

The first line tells Python to load a **module** named `turtle`. That module brings us two new types that we can use: the `Turtle` type, and the `Screen` type. The dot notation `turtle.Turtle` means *“The Turtle type that is defined within the turtle module”*. (Remember that Python is case sensitive, so the module name, `turtle`, with a lowercase `t`, is different from the type `Turtle` because of the uppercase `T`.)

We then create and open what the turtle module calls a screen (we would prefer to call it a window, or in the case of this web version of Python simply a canvas), which we assign to variable `wn`. Every window contains a canvas, which is the area inside the window on which we can draw.

In line 3 we create a turtle. The variable `alex` is made to refer to this turtle. These first three lines set us up so that we are ready to do some drawing.

In lines 4-6, we instruct the object alex to move and to turn. We do this by invoking or activating alex’s methods — these are the instructions that all turtles know how to respond to.


**Mixed up programs**

**E1** : The following program uses a turtle to draw a capital L as shown in the picture to the left of this text, image of a navigational compass and a letter L which is drawn by Turtle but the lines are mixed up. The program should do all necessary set-up: import the turtle module, get the window to draw on, and create the turtle. Remember that the turtle starts off facing east when it is created. The turtle should turn to face south and draw a line that is 150 pixels long and then turn to face east and draw a line that is 75 pixels long. We have added a compass to the picture to indicate the directions north, south, west, and east.

```python
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
ella = turtle.Turtle()
ella.right(90)
ella.forward(150)
ella.left(90)
ella.forward(75)
```


**E2** : The following program uses a turtle to draw a checkmark as shown to the left, image of a navigational compass and a checkmark which is drawn by Turtle. but the lines are mixed up. The program should do all necessary set-up: import the turtle module, get the window to draw on, and create the turtle. The turtle should turn to face southeast, draw a line that is 75 pixels long, then turn to face northeast, and draw a line that is 150 pixels long. We have added a compass to the picture to indicate the directions north, south, west, and east. Northeast is between north and east. Southeast is between south and east.

```python
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
maria = turtle.Turtle()
maria.right(45)
maria.forward(75)
maria.left(90)
maria.forward(150)
```

**E3** : The following program uses a turtle to draw a single line to the west as shown to the left, image of a line moving in west direction drawn by Turtle. Turtle uses following steps: left turn of 180 degrees, and 75 pixels long line but the program lines are mixed up. The program should do all necessary set-up: import the turtle module, get the window to draw on, and create the turtle. The turtle should then turn to face west and draw a line that is 75 pixels long.

```python
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
jamal = turtle.Turtle()
jamal.left(180)
jamal.forward(75)
```


An object can have various methods — things it can do — and it can also have **attributes** — (sometimes called properties). For example, each turtle has a color attribute. The method invocation `alex.color("red")` will make alex red and the line that it draws will be red too.

The color of the turtle, the width of its pen(tail), the position of the turtle within the window, which way it is facing, and so on are all part of its current state. Similarly, the window object has a background color which is part of its state.

Quite a number of methods exist that allow us to modify the turtle and window objects. In the example below, we show just show a couple and have only commented those lines that are different from the previous example. Note also that we have decided to call our turtle object tess.


```python
import turtle

wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")        # set the window background color

tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")              # make tess blue
tess.pensize(3)                 # set the width of her pen

tess.forward(50)
tess.left(120)
tess.forward(50)

wn.exitonclick()                # wait for a user click on the canvas
```

The last line plays a very important role. The wn variable refers to the window shown above. When we invoke its `exitonclick` method, the program pauses execution and waits for the user to click the mouse somewhere in the window. When this click event occurs, the response is to close the turtle window and exit (stop execution of) the Python program.

Each time we run this program, a new drawing window pops up, and will remain on the screen until we click on it.

**Extend this program …**

1. Modify this program so that before it creates the window, it prompts the user to enter the desired background color.It should store the user’s responses in a variable, and modify the color of the window according to the user’s wishes. (Hint: you can find a list of permitted color names at https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp. It includes some quite unusual ones, like “PeachPuff” and “HotPink”.)
2. Do similar changes to allow the user, at runtime, to set tess’ color.
3. Do the same for the width of tess’ pen. Hint: your dialog with the user will return a string, but tess’ `pensize` method expects its argument to be an `int`. That means you need to convert the string to an int before you pass it to `pensize`.
