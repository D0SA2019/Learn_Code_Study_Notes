**A1**. Write code to draw a regular pentagon (a five-sided figure with all sides the same length).


```python
import turtle
sc = turtle.Screen()

steve = turtle.Turtle()

for line in range(5):
    steve.left(72)
    steve.forward(50)
```

**A2**. Write a program that uses the turtle module to draw something. It doesn’t have to be complicated, but draw something different than we have done in the past. (Hint: if you are drawing something complicated, it could get tedious to watch it draw over and over. Try setting .speed(10) for the turtle to draw fast, or .speed(0) for it to draw super fast with no animation.)


```python
import turtle
sc = turtle.Screen()

steve = turtle.Turtle()
steve.left(180)
steve.forward(60)
steve.left(90)
steve.forward(30)
steve.left(90)
steve.forward(60)
steve.right(90)
steve.forward(30)
steve.right(90)
steve.forward(60)

steve.penup()
steve.forward(30)
steve.pendown()
steve.right(90)
steve.forward(90)
steve.right(90)
steve.forward(120)
steve.right(90)
steve.forward(120)
steve.right(90)
steve.forward(120)
steve.right(90)
steve.forward(30)
```

import turtle
sc = turtle.Screen()

steve = turtle.Turtle()


for line in range(3):

    steve.forward(50)

steve.penup()
steve.right(90)
steve.forward(150)
steve.right(35)
steve.pendown()

for line in range(8):
