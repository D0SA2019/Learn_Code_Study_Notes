## Week 3 : Booleans and Conditionals
### 3.5. Conditional Execution


In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. **Selection statements**, sometimes also referred to as **conditional statements**, give us this ability. The simplest form of selection is the **if statement**. This is sometimes referred to as **binary selection** since there are two possible paths of execution.

```python
x = 15

if x % 2 == 0:
	print(x, "is even")
else:
	print(x, "is odd")
```

**Output** :

```
15 is odd
```

The syntax for an `if` statement looks like this:


```python
if BOOLEAN EXPRESSION :
	STATEMENTS_1					# executed if condition evaluates to True
else :
	STATEMENTS_2					# executes if condition evaluates to False
```

The boolean expression after the `if` statement is called the **condition**. If it is true, then the indented statements get executed. If not, then the statements indented under the `else` clause get executed.

As with the function definition from the last chapter and other compound statements like `for`, the `if` statement consists of a header line and a body. The header line begins with the keyword `if` followed by a boolean expression and ends with a colon (:).

The indented statements that follow are called a **block**. The first unindented statement marks the end of the block.

Each of the statements inside the first block of statements is executed in order if the boolean expression evaluates to `True`. The entire first block of statements is skipped if the boolean expression evaluates to `False`, and instead all the statements under the `else` clause are executed.

There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear under the two clauses of an `if` statement, but there has to be at least one statement in each block.

**Check Your Understanding**

**E1** : How many lines of code can appear in the indented code block below the if and else lines in a conditional?

A. Just one. <br>
B. Zero or more. <br>
C. One or more. ✅ <br>
D. One or more, and each must contain the same number. <br>


----

**E2** : What does the following code print? (choose from output a, b, c or nothing)

```python
if (4 + 5 == 10):
	print("TRUE")
else:
	print("FALSE")
```

A. TRUE <br>
B. FALSE ✅ <br>
C. TRUE on one line and FALSE on the next <br>
D. Nothing will be printed <br>



----

**E3** : What does the following code print?

```python
if (4 + 5 == 10):
	print("TRUE")
else:
	print("FALSE")
print("TRUE")
```

```
a. TRUE

b.
   TRUE
   FALSE

c.
   FALSE
   TRUE
d.
   TRUE
   FALSE
   TRUE
```

A. Output a <br>
B. Output b <br>
C. Output c ✅ <br>
D. Output d <br>



----

**E4** : Write code to assign the string `"You can apply to SI!"` to output if the string `"SI 106"` is in the list courses. If it is not in `courses`, assign the value `"Take SI 106!"` to the variable `output`.

```python
courses = ["ENGR 101", "SI 110", "ENG 125", "SI 106", "CHEM 130"]

if "SI 106" in courses:
    output = "You can apply to SI!"
else :
    output = "Take SI 106!"
print(output)
```


**Output** :

```
You can apply to SI!
```


----

**E5** : Create a variable, `b`, and assign it the value of `15`. Then, write code to see if the value `b` is greater than that of `a`. If it is, `a`’s value should be multiplied by 2. If the value of `b` is less than or equal to `a`, nothing should happen. Finally, create variable `c` and assign it the value of the sum of `a` and `b`.

```python
# Given
a = 20


# Solution
b = 15

if b > a :
	a = a * 2
else:
	pass

c = a + b
print(c)
```

**Output** :

```
35
```
