### 1.17. More Turtle Methods

Here are a few more things that you might find useful as you write programs that use turtles.

Turtle methods can use negative angles or distances. So tess.forward(-100) will move tess backwards, and tess.left(-30) turns her to the right. Additionally, because there are 360 degrees in a circle, turning 30 to the left will leave you facing in the same direction as turning 330 to the right! (The on-screen animation will differ, though — you will be able to tell if tess is turning clockwise or counter-clockwise!)

This suggests that we don’t need both a left and a right turn method — we could be minimalists, and just have one method. There is also a backward method. (If you are very nerdy, you might enjoy saying alex.backward(-100) to move alex forward!)

Reviewing a few basic facts about geometry and number lines, like we’ve done here is a good start if we’re going to play with turtles.

A turtle’s pen can be picked up or put down. This allows us to move a turtle to a different place without drawing a line. The methods are `up` and `down`. Note that the methods `penup` and `pendown` do the same thing.

```python
alex.up()
alex.forward(100)     # this moves alex, but no line is drawn
alex.down()
```

Every turtle can have its own shape. The ones available “out of the box” are `arrow`, `blank`, `circle`, `classic`, `square`, `triangle`, `turtle`.

```python
...
alex.shape("turtle")
...
```

You can speed up or slow down the turtle’s animation speed. (Animation controls how quickly the turtle turns and moves forward). Speed settings can be set between 1 (slowest) to 10 (fastest). But if you set the speed to 0, it has a special meaning — turn off animation and go as fast as possible.

```python
alex.speed(10)
```

A turtle can “stamp” its footprint onto the canvas, and this will remain after the turtle has moved somewhere else. Stamping works even when the pen is up.


```python
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")
tess.shape("turtle")

dist = 5
tess.up()                     # this is new
for _ in range(30):    # start with size = 5 and grow by 2
    tess.stamp()                # leave an impression on the canvas
    tess.forward(dist)          # move tess along
    tess.right(24)              # and turn her
    dist = dist + 2
wn.exitonclick()
```

If you are curious about how far the turtle is traveling each time the for loop iterates, you can add a print statement inside of the for loop to print out the value of `dist`.

One more thing to be careful about. All except one of the shapes you see on the screen here are footprints created by `stamp`. But the program still only has one turtle instance — can you figure out which one is the real tess? (Hint: if you’re not sure, write a new line of code after the `for` loop to change tess’ color, or to put her pen down and draw a line, or to change her shape, etc.)

**Mixed up program**

**E1** : The following program uses the stamp method to create a circle of turtle shapes as shown to the left, image of a circle of turtle shapes but the lines are mixed up. The program should do all necessary set-up, create the turtle, set the shape to "turtle", and pick up the pen. Then the turtle should repeat the following ten times: go forward 50 pixels, leave a copy of the turtle at the current position, reverse for 50 pixels, and then turn right 36 degrees. After the loop, set the window to close when the user clicks in it.

```python
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
jose = turtle.Turtle()
jose.shape("turtle")
jose.penup()

for size in range(10):
	jose.forward(50)
	jose.stamp()
	jose.forward(-50)
	jose.right(36)

wn.exitonclick()
```

**E2** : The following program uses the stamp method to create a line of turtle shapes as shown to the left, image of a line of turtle shapes but the lines are mixed up. The program should do all necessary set-up, create the turtle, set the shape to "turtle", and pick up the pen. Then the turtle should repeat the following three times: go forward 50 pixels and leave a copy of the turtle at the current position. After the loop, set the window to close when the user clicks in it.

```python
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
nikea = turtle.Turtle()
nikea.shape("turtle")
nikea.penup()

for size in range(3):
	nikea.forward(50)
	nikea.stamp()

wn.exitonclick()
```
