## Week 2 : Sequences and Iteration
### 2.3. Length

The `len` function, when applied to a string, returns the number of characters in a string.

```python
fruit = "Banana"
print(len(fruit))
```

**Output** :

```
6
```

To get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something like this:

```python
fruit = "Banana"
sz = len(fruit)
last = fruit[sz]
print(last)
```

**Output** :

```
IndexError: string index out of range on line 3
```

That won’t work. It causes the runtime error I`ndexError: string index out of range`. The reason is that there is no letter at index position 6 in `"Banana"`. Since we started counting at zero, the six indexes are numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character, we have to subtract 1 from the length. Give it a try in the example above.

```python
fruit = "Banana"
sz = len(fruit)
last = fruit[sz-1]
print(last)
```

**Output** :

```
a
```

Typically, a Python programmer will access the last character by combining the two lines of code from above.

```python
lastch = fruit[len(fruit)-1]
```

As with strings, the function `len` returns the length of a list (the number of items in the list). However, since lists can have items which are themselves sequences (e.g., strings), it important to note that `len` only returns the top-most length.

```python
alist = ["hello", 2.0, 5]
print(len(alist))
print(len(alist[0]))
```

**Output** :

```
3
5
```

Note that `alist[0]` is the string `"hello"`, which has length 5.

**E4** : Assign the number of elements in `lst` to the variable `output`.

```python
lst = ["hi", "morning", "dog", "506", "caterpillar", "balloons", 106, "yo-yo", "python", "moon", "water", "sleepy", "daffy", 45, "donald", "whiteboard", "glasses", "markers", "couches", "butterfly", "100", "magazine", "door", "picture", "window", ["Olympics", "handle"], "chair", "pages", "readings", "burger", "juggle", "craft", ["store", "poster", "board"], "laptop", "computer", "plates", "hotdog", "salad", "backpack", "zipper", "ring", "watch", "finger", "bags", "boxes", "pods", "peas", "apples", "horse", "guinea pig", "bowl", "EECS"]
```


***Solution***:

```python
lst = ["hi", "morning", "dog", "506", "caterpillar", "balloons", 106, "yo-yo", "python", "moon", "water", "sleepy", "daffy", 45, "donald", "whiteboard", "glasses", "markers", "couches", "butterfly", "100", "magazine", "door", "picture", "window", ["Olympics", "handle"], "chair", "pages", "readings", "burger", "juggle", "craft", ["store", "poster", "board"], "laptop", "computer", "plates", "hotdog", "salad", "backpack", "zipper", "ring", "watch", "finger", "bags", "boxes", "pods", "peas", "apples", "horse", "guinea pig", "bowl", "EECS"]
output = len(lst)
print(output)
```

***Output*** :

```
52
```
