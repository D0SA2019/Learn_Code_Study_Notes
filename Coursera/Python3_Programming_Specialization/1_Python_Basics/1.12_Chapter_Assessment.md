#### Assessments

**A1**. There is a function we are providing in for you in this problem called square. It takes one integer and returns the square of that integer value. Write code to assign a variable called xyz the value 5*5 (five squared). Use the square function, rather than just multiplying with `*`.


```python
xyz = square(5)
```

-----

**A2**. Write code to assign the number of characters in the string `rv` to a variable `num_chars`.


```python
rv = """Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
    'Tis some visitor, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door;
    Only this and nothing more."""

# Write your code here!
num_chars = len(rv)
```

#### Exercises

**Q1**. Evaluate the following numerical expressions in your head, then use the active code window to check your results:

* 5 ** 2
* 9 * 5
* 15 / 12
* 12 / 15
* 15 // 12
* 12 // 15
* 5 % 2
* 9 % 5
* 15 % 12
* 12 % 15
* 6 % 6
* 0 % 7


```python
print(5 ** 2)
print(9 * 5)
print(15 / 12)
print(12 / 15)
print(15 // 12)
print(5 % 2)
print(9 % 5)
print(15 % 12)
print(12 % 15)
print(6 % 6)
print(0 % 7)
```

**Output** :

```
25
45
1.25
0.8
1
1
4
3
12
0
0
```

----

**Q2**. What is the order of the arithmetic operations in the following expression. Evaluate the expression by hand and then check your work.


```python
2 + (3 - 1) * 10 / 5 * (2 + 3)

print(2 + (3 - 1) * 10 / 5 * (2 + 3))
```

**Output** :

```
22.0
```
----

**Q3**. Many people keep time using a 24 hour clock (11 is 11am and 23 is 11pm, 0 is midnight). If it is currently 13 and you set your alarm to go off in 50 hours, it will be 15 (3pm). Write a Python program to solve the general version of the above problem. Ask the user for the time now (in hours), and then ask for the number of hours to wait for the alarm. Your program should output what the time will be on the clock when the alarm goes off.


```python
time_now = int(input("What time now? "))
time_wait = int(input("How much time to wait? "))

clock = (time_now + time_wait) % 24
print(clock)
```

**Output** :

```
What time now? 12
How much time to wait? 17
5
```
----

**Q4**. It is possible to name the days 0 thru 6 where day 0 is Sunday and day 6 is Saturday. If you go on a wonderful holiday leaving on day number 3 (a Wednesday) and you return home after 10 nights you would return home on a Saturday (day 6). Write a general version of the program which asks for the starting day number, and the length of your stay, and it will tell you the number of day of the week you will return on.


```python
holiday_start = int(input("Day of starting your holiday? "))
holiday_stay = int(input("How many days stay on holiday? "))

return_day = (holiday_start + holiday_stay) % 7
print(return_day)
```

**Output** :

```
Day of starting your holiday? 3
How many days stay on holiday? 10
6
```
----
**Q5**. Take the sentence: *All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.* Store each word in a separate variable, then print out the sentence on one line using `print`.


```python
w1 = "All"
w2 = "work"
w3 = "and"
w4 = "no"
w5 = "play"
w6 = "makes"
w7 = "Jack"
w8 = "a"
w9 = "dull"
w10 = "boy."

print(w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10)
```

**Output** :

```
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
```
----
**Q6**. Add parentheses to the expression `6 * 1 - 2` to change its value from 4 to -6.


```python
print(6 * (1 - 2))
```

**Output** :

```
-6
```

----
**Q7**. The formula for computing the final amount if one is earning compound interest is given on Wikipedia as

![](https://fopp.umsi.education/runestone/static/fopp/_images/compoundInterest.png)

Write a Python program that assigns the principal amount of 10000 to variable `P`, assign to `n` the value 12, and assign to `r` the interest rate of 8% (0.08). Then have the program prompt the user for the number of years, `t`, that the money will be compounded for. Calculate and print the final amount after `t` years.

```python
P = 10000
n = 12
r = 0.08
t = int(input("How many years? "))

A = P * ((1 + (r / n)) ** (n * t))
print(A)
```

**Output** :

```
How many years? 2
11728.879317453097
```


----
**Q8**. Write a program that will compute the area of a circle. Prompt the user to enter the radius and print a nice message back to the user with the answer.

```python
r = int(input("Enter the radius: "))
pi = 3.14

A = pi * (r ** 2)
print("The area of the circle is ", A)
```

**Output** :

```
Enter the radius: 3
The area of the circle is  28.26
```

----
**Q9**. Write a program that will compute the area of a rectangle. Prompt the user to enter the width and height of the rectangle. Print a nice message with the answer.

```python
w = int(input("What's the width? "))
l = int(input("What's the lenght? "))

A = w * l
print("The area of the rectangle is", A)
```

**Output** :

```
What's the width? 2
What's the lenght? 4
The area of the rectangle is 8
```

----
**Q10**. Write a program that will compute MPG for a car. Prompt the user to enter the number of miles driven and the number of gallons used. Print a nice message with the answer.

```python
driven_mile = int(input("Miles? "))
used_gallon = int(input("Gallon? "))

mpg = driven_mile / used_gallon
print("MPG of the car is", mpg)
```

**Output** :

```
Miles? 200
Gallon? 18
MPG of the car is 11.11111111111111
```

----
**Q11**. Write a program that will convert degrees celsius to degrees fahrenheit.

```python
c = int(input("What's the temperature on Celcius? "))
f = (((9 / 5)* c )+ 32)

print("It's", f, "Fahrenheit")
```

**Output** :

```
What's the temperature on Celcius? 30
It's 86.0 Fahrenheit
```

----
**Q12**. Write a program that will convert degrees fahrenheit to degrees celsius.

```python
f = int(input("What's the temperature on Fahrenheit? "))
c = (5 / 9) * (f - 32)

print("It's", c, "Celcius")
```

**Output** :

```
What's the temperature on Fahrenheit? 86
It's 30.0 Celcius
```

----
**Q13**. Piece together the code so that a user is asked for two numbers, and then the sum of those two numbers is printed out.
