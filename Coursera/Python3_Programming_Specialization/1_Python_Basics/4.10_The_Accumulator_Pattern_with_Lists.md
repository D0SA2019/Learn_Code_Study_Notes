## Week 4 : Sequence Mutation and Accumulation Patterns
### 4.10. The Accumulator Pattern with Lists

We can accumulate values into a list rather than accumulating a single numeric value. Consider, for example, the following program which transforms a list into a new list by squaring each of the values.

```python
nums = [3, 5, 8]
accum = []
for w in nums:
	x = w ** 2
	accum.append(x)
print(accum)
```

**Output** :

```
[9, 25, 64]
```

Here, we **initialize** the accumulator variable to be an empty list, on line 2.

We **iterate** through the sequence (line 3). On each iteration we transform the item by squaring it (line 4).

The **update** step appends the new item to the list which is stored in the accumulator variable (line 5). The update happens using the .append(), which mutates the list rather than using a reassignment. Instead, we could have written `accum = accum + [x]`, or `accum += [x]`. In either case, we’d need to concatenate a list containing x, not just x itself.

At the end, we have accumulated a new list of the same length as the original, but with each item transformed into a new item. This is called a mapping operation, and we will revisit it in a later chapter.

Note how this differs from mutating the original list, as you saw in a previous section.

**Check Your Understanding**


**E1** : What is printed by the following statements?

```python
alist = [4, 2, 8, 6, 5]
blist = []
for item in alist:
	blist.append(item+5)
print(blist)
```

A. [4,2,8,6,5]  <br>
B. [4,2,8,6,5,5]  <br>
C. [9,7,13,11,10]  ✅ <br>
D. Error, you cannot concatenate inside an append.  <br>

---

**E2** : What is printed by the following statements?

```python
lst = [3, 0, 9, 4, 1, 7]
new_list = []
for i in range(len(lst)):
	new_list.append(lst[i]+5)
print(new_list)
```

A. [8,5,14,9,6]  <br>
B. [8,5,14,9,6,12]  ✅ <br>
C. [3,0,9,4,1,7,5]  <br>
D. Error, you cannot concatenate inside an append.  <br>

**E3** : For each word in the list `verbs`, add an -ing ending. Save this new list in a new list, `ing`.

```python
# Given
verbs = ["kayak", "cry", "walk", "eat", "drink", "fly"]



# Solution
verbs = ["kayak", "cry", "walk", "eat", "drink", "fly"]
ing = []
for word in verbs:
    word = word + "ing"
    ing.append(word)
print(ing)
```

**Output**:

```
['kayaking', 'crying', 'walking', 'eating', 'drinking', 'flying']
```

**E4** : Given the list of numbers, `numbs`, create a new list of those same numbers increased by 5. Save this new list to the variable `newlist`.

```python
# Given
numbs = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]


# Solution
numbs = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
newlist = []

for num in numbs:
    num += 5
    newlist.append(num)
print(newlist)
```

**Output**:

```
[10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
```

---


**E5** : Now do the same as in the previous problem, but do not create a new list. Overwrite the list numbs so that each of the original numbers are increased by 5.

```python
# Given
numbs = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]


# Solution
numbs = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

for num in numbs:
    new_num = num + 5
    numbs.remove(num)
    numbs.append(new_num)
print(numbs)
```

**Output**:

```
[10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
```

---


**E6** : For each number in `lst_nums`, multiply that number by 2 and append it to a new list called `larger_nums`.

```python
# Given
lst_nums = [4, 29, 5.3, 10, 2, 1817, 1967, 9, 31.32]


# Solution
lst_nums = [4, 29, 5.3, 10, 2, 1817, 1967, 9, 31.32]
larger_nums = []
for number in lst_nums:
    number = number * 2
    larger_nums.append(number)
print(larger_nums)
```

**Output**:

```
[8, 58, 10.6, 20, 4, 3634, 3934, 18, 62.64]
```
