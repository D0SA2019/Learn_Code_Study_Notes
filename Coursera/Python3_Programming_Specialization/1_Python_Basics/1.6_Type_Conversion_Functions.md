### 1.6. Type Conversion Functions

Sometimes it is necessary to convert values from one type to another. Python provides a few simple functions that will allow us to do that. The functions `int`, `float` and `str` will (attempt to) convert their arguments into types `int`, `float` and `str` respectively. We call these type conversion functions.

The `int` function can take a floating point number or a string, and turn it into an int. For floating point numbers, it discards the decimal portion of the number - a process we call truncation towards zero on the number line. Let us see this in action:

```python
print(3.14, int(3.14))
print(3.9999, int(3.9999))
print(-3.9999, int(-3.9999))
print("2345", int("2345"))
print(17, int(17))
print(int("23bottless"))
```

**Output**:

```
3.14 3
3.9999 3
-3.9999 -3
2345 2345
17 17
Traceback (most recent call last):
    print(int("23bottless"))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '23bottless'
```

The last case shows that a string has to be a syntactically legal number, otherwise you’ll get one of those pesky runtime errors. Modify the example by deleting the `bottles` and rerun the program. You should see the integer `23`.

The type converter `float` can turn an integer, a float, or a syntactically legal string into a float.

```python
print(float("123.45"))
print(type(float("123.45")))
```

**Output**:

```
123.45
<class 'float'>
```

The type converter `str` turns its argument into a string. Remember that when we print a string, the quotes are removed in the output window. However, if we print the type, we can see that it is definitely `str`.

```python
print(str(17))
print(str(123.45))
print(type(str(123.45)))
```

**Output**:

```
17
123.45
<class 'str'>
```

One common operation where you might need to do a type conversion is when you are concatenating several strings together but want to include a numeric value as part of the final string. Because we can’t concatenate a string with an integer or floating point number, we will often have to convert numbers to strings before concatenating them.
