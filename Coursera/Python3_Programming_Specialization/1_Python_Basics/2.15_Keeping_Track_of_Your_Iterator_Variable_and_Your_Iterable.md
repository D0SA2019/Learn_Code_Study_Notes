## Week 2 : Sequences and Iteration
### 2.15. Keeping Track of Your Iterator Variable and Your Iterable

When students first begin using for loops, they sometimes have difficulty understanding the difference between the iterator variable (the loop variable) and the iterable.

The iterable is the object that you will parsing through in a for loop. Generally, this object does not change while the for loop is being executed.

The iterator (loop) variable is the variable which stores a portion of the iterable when the for loop is being executed. Each time the loop iterates, the value of the iterator variable will change to a different portion of the iterable.


**E1** : What is the type of your iterable?

```python
n = ["word", "phrase", 8, ("beam")]

for item in n:
	print(item)
```

A. string <br>
B. list ✅ <br>
C. tuple <br>
D. iterable <br>
E. error, unable to iterate over the object. <br>


**Output** :

```
word
phrase
8
beam
```


**E2** : What is the type of your iterable?

```python
t = "couch"

for z in t:
	print(z)
```

A. string ✅<br>
B. list <br>
C. tuple <br>
D. iterable <br>
E. error, unable to iterate over the object. <br>


**Output** :

```
c
o
u
c
h
```


**E3** : What is the type of your iterable?

```python
y = 18

for z in y:
	print(z)
```

A. string <br>
B. list <br>
C. tuple <br>
D. iterable <br>
E. error, unable to iterate over the object. ✅ <br>



**E4** : What is the type of your iterable?

```python
t = ("couch", "chair", "washer", "dryer", "table")

for z in t:
	print(z)
```

A. string <br>
B. list <br>
C. tuple ✅ <br>
D. iterable <br>
E. error, unable to iterate over the object. <br>


**Output** :

```
couch
chair
washer
dryer
table
```


**E5** : What is the type of your iterable?

```python
t = "couch"

for z in t:
	print(z)
```

A. string ✅ <br>
B. list <br>
C. tuple <br>
D. iterable <br>
E. error, unable to iterate over the object. <br>


**Output** :

```
c
o
u
c
h
```


**E6** : What is the type of your iterator variable?

```python
t = ["couch", "chair", "washer", "dryer", "table"]

for z in t:
	print(z)
```

A. string ✅ <br>
B. list <br>
C. tuple <br>
D. iterable <br>
E. error, unable to iterate over the object. <br>


**Output** :

```
couch
chair
washer
dryer
table
```


**E7** : What’s the type of your iterator variable in the first iteration?

```python
t = [9, "setter", 3, "wing spiker", 10, "middle blocker"]

for z in t:
	print(z)
```

A. string <br>
B. list <br>
C. tuple <br>
D. integer ✅ <br>
E. error, unable to iterate and initialize the iterator variable <br>


**Output** :

```
9
setter
3
wing spiker
10
middle blocker
```


**E8** : What’s the type of your iterator variable in the second iteration?

```python
t = [9, "setter", 3, "wing spiker", 10, "middle blocker"]

for z in t:
	print(z)
```

A. string ✅ <br>
B. list <br>
C. tuple <br>
D. integer <br>
E. error, unable to iterate and initialize the iterator variable <br>


**Output** :

```
9
setter
3
wing spiker
10
middle blocker
```

**E9** : What’s the type of your iterator variable in the final iteration?

```python
red = "colors"

for blue in red:
	print(blue)
```

A. string ✅ <br>
B. list <br>
C. tuple <br>
D. integer <br>
E. error, unable to iterate and initialize the iterator variable <br>


**Output** :

```
c
o
l
o
r
s
```
