### 1.1. Welcome to Python Basics!

Programming is giving a list of instructins for a computer to follow. In the contest of programming, this instructions are sometimes called algorithms.

The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example of a **high-level language**; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C++, PHP, and Java.

As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also **low-level languages**, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous.

First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.

Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized applications.

Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: **interpreters** and **compilers**. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.

A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the **source code**, and the translated program is called the object code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation.

Many modern languages use both processes. They are first compiled into a lower level language, called byte code, and then interpreted by a program called a virtual machine. Python uses both processes, but because of the way programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.

**More About Programs**

A **program** is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something as complex as rendering an html page in a web browser or encoding a video and streaming it across the network. It can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching for and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.

The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language.

***input***

Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.

***output***

Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.

***math and logic***

Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication and logical operations like `and`, `or`, and `not`.

***conditional execution***

Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.

***repetition***

Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look more or less like these. Thus, we can describe programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with sequences of these basic instructions.


**A Typical First Program**

Traditionally, the first program written in a new language is called *Hello, World!* because all it does is display the words, Hello, World! In Python, the source code looks like this.

```python
print("Hello World!")
```
This is an example of using the `print` function, which doesn’t actually print anything on paper. It displays a value on the screen. In this case, the result is the phrase:

```
Hello World!
```

The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the value. They don’t appear in the result.
