## Week 3 : Booleans and Conditionals
### 3.7. Nested Conditionals

One conditional can also be **nested** within another. For example, assume we have two integer variables, `x` and `y`. The following pattern of selection shows how we might decide how they are related to each other.

```python
if x < y :
	print("x is less than y")
else:
	if x > y :
		print("x is greater than y")
	else:
		print("x and y must be equal")
```

The outer conditional contains two branches. The second branch (the else from the outer) contains another `if` statement, which has two branches of its own. Those two branches could contain conditional statements as well.

The flow of control for this example can be seen in this flowchart illustration.

Here is a complete program that defines values for `x` and `y`. Run the program and see the result. Then change the values of the variables to change the flow of control.

```python
x = 10
y = 10

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    if x > y:
        print("x is greater than y")
    else:
        print("x and y must be equal")
```

**Output** :

```
x and y must be equal
```

**Check Your Understanding**

**E1** : Will the following code cause an error?

```python
x = -10
if x < 0:
	print("The negative number ", x, " is not valid here.")
else:
	if x > 0 :
		print(x, " is a positive number")
	else:
		print(x, " is 0")
```
