## Week 2 : Sequences and Iteration
### 2.9. The For Loop

Back when we drew the images with turtle it could be quite tedious. If we wanted to draw a square then we had to move then turn, move then turn, etc. etc. four times. If we were drawing a hexagon, or an octagon, or a polygon with 42 sides, it would have been a nightmare to duplicate all that code.

A basic building block of all programs is to be able to repeat some code over and over again. We refer to this repetitive idea as **iteration**. In this section, we will explore some mechanisms for basic iteration.

In Python, the for statement allows us to write programs that implement iteration. As a simple example, let’s say we have some friends, and we’d like to send them each an email inviting them to our party. We don’t quite know how to send email yet, so for the moment we’ll just print a message for each friend.


```python
for name in ["Joe", "Amy", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
	print("Hi", name, "Please come to my party on Saturday!")
```

**Output** :

```
Hi Joe Please come to my party on Saturday!
Hi Amy Please come to my party on Saturday!
Hi Brad Please come to my party on Saturday!
Hi Angelina Please come to my party on Saturday!
Hi Zuki Please come to my party on Saturday!
Hi Thandi Please come to my party on Saturday!
Hi Paris Please come to my party on Saturday!
```


Take a look at the output produced when you press the `run` button. There is one line printed for each friend. Here’s how it works:

* **name** in this `for` statement is called the **loop variable** or, alternatively, the **iterator variable**.
* The list of names in the square brackets is the sequence over which we will iterate.
* Line 2 is the **loop body**. The loop body is always indented. The indentation determines exactly what statements are “in the loop”. The loop body is performed one time for each name in the list.
* On each *iteration* or *pass* of the loop, first a check is done to see if there are still more items to be processed. If there are none left (this is called the **terminating condition** of the loop), the loop has finished. Program execution continues at the next statement after the loop body.
* If there are items still to be processed, the loop variable is updated to refer to the next item in the list. This means, in this case, that the loop body is executed here 7 times, and each time `name` will refer to a different friend.
* At the end of each execution of the body of the loop, Python returns to the `for` statement, to see if there are more items to be handled.

The overall syntax is `for <loop_var_name> in <sequence>:`

* Between the words `for` and `in`, there must be a variable name for the loop variable. You can’t put a whole expression there.
* A colon is required at the end of the line
* After the word in and before the colon is an expression that must evaluate to a sequence (e.g, a string or a list or a tuple). It could be a literal, or a variable name, or a more complex expression.


#### Flow of Execution of the `for` Loop

As a program executes, the interpreter always keeps track of which statement is about to be executed. We call this the **control flow**, or the **flow of execution** of the program. When humans execute programs, they often use their finger to point to each statement in turn. So you could think of control flow as “Python’s moving finger”.


Control flow until now has been strictly top to bottom, one statement at a time. We call this type of control **sequential**. Sequential flow of control is always assumed to be the default behavior for a computer program. The `for` statement changes this.


Flow of control is often easy to visualize and understand if we draw a flowchart. This flowchart shows the exact steps and logic of how the `for` statement executes.

While loops may not seem to be necessary when you’re iterating over a few items, it is extremely helpful when iterating over lots of items. Imagine if you needed to change what happened in the code block. On the left, when you use iteration, this is easy. On the right, when you have hard coded the process, this is more difficult.

#### Strings and `for` loops


Since a string is simply a sequence of characters, the `for` loop iterates over each character automatically.

```python
for achar in "Go Spot Go":
	print("char")
```

**Output** :

```
G
o

S
p
o
t

G
o
```

The loop variable `achar` is automatically reassigned each character in the string “Go Spot Go”. We will refer to this type of sequence iteration as **iteration by item**. Note that the for loop processes the characters in a string or items in a sequence one at a time from left to right.


#### Lists and `for` loops

It is also possible to perform **list traversal** using iteration by item. A list is a sequence of items, so the `for` loop iterates over each item in the list automatically.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]

for afruit in fruits:
	print(afruit)
```

**Output** :

```
apple
orange
banana
cherry
```

It almost reads like natural language: For (every) fruit in (the list of) fruits, print (the name of the) fruit.


#### Iteration Simplifies our Turtle Program

To draw a square we’d like to do the same thing four times — move the turtle forward some distance and turn 90 degrees. We previously used 8 lines of Python code to have alex draw the four sides of a square. This next program does exactly the same thing but, with the help of the for statement, uses just three lines (not including the setup code). Remember that the for statement will repeat the forward and left four times, one time for each value in the list.

```python
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()
alex.speed(1)

for i in [0,1,2,3]:
	alex.forward(50)
	alex.left(90)

wn.exitonclick()
```

**Output** :

While “saving some lines of code” might be convenient, it is not the big deal here. What is much more important is that we’ve found a “repeating pattern” of statements, and we reorganized our program to repeat the pattern.

The values [0,1,2,3] were provided to make the loop body execute 4 times. We could have used any four values. For example, consider the following program.


```python
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()
alex.speed(1)

for i in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
	alex.forward(50)
	alex.left(90)

wn.exitonclick()
```

**Output** :

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/JNsxfnGjDxXiBFfah9/giphy.gif)


In the previous example, there were four integers in the list. This time there are four strings. Since there are four items in the list, the iteration will still occur four times. `aColor` will take on each color in the list. We can even take this one step further and use the value of `aColor` as part of the computation.


```python
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()
alex.speed(1)

for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
	alex.color(aColor)
	alex.forward(50)
	alex.left(90)

wn.exitonclick()
```

**Output** :

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/kaBYWace19K4sBiTty/giphy.gif)


In this case, the value of `aColor` is used to change the color attribute of `alex`. Each iteration causes `aColor` to change to the next value in the list.

The for-loop is our first example of a **compound statement**. Syntactically a compound statement is a statement. The level of indentation of a (whole) compound statement is the indentation of its heading. In the example above there are five statements with the same indentation, executed sequentially: the import, 2 assignments, the whole for-loop, and `wn.exitonclick()`. The for-loop compound statement is executed completely before going on to the next sequential statement, `wn.exitonclick()`.
