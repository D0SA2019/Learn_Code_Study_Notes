## Week 4 : Sequence Mutation and Accumulation Patterns
### 4.5. Cloning Lists

If we want to modify a list and also keep a copy of the original, we need to be able to make a copy of the list itself, not just the reference. This process is sometimes called **cloning**, to avoid the ambiguity of the word copy.

The easiest way to clone a list is to use the slice operator.

Taking any slice of `a` creates a new list. In this case the slice happens to consist of the whole list.


```python
a = [81, 82, 83]

b = a[:]
print(a == b)
print(a is b)

b[0] = 5
print(a)
print(b)
```

**Output** :

```
True
False
[81, 82, 83]
[5, 82, 83]
```

Now we are free to make changes to `b` without worrying about `a`.

**Check Your Understanding**

**E1** : What is printed by the following statements?

```python
alist = [4, 2, 8, 6, 5]
blist = alist * 2
blist[3] = 999
print(alist)
```

A. [4,2,8,999,5,4,2,8,6,5] <br>
B. [4,2,8,999,5] <br>
C. [4,2,8,6,5] âœ… <br>
