## Week 3 : Functions and Tuples
### 3.5. A Function that Accumulates

We have used the `len` function a lot already. If it weren’t part of python, our lives as programmers would have been a lot harder.

Well, actually, not that much harder. Now that we know how to define functions, we could define `len` ourselves if it did not exist. Previously, we have used the accumlator pattern to count the number of lines in a file. Let’s use that same idea and just wrap it in a function definition. We’ll call it `mylen` to distinguish it from the real `len` which already exists. We actually could call it len, but that wouldn’t be a very good idea, because it would replace the original len function, and our implementation may not be a very good one.


```python
def mylen(seq):
	c = 0
	for _ in seq:
		c = c + 1
	return c

print(mylen("hello"))
print(mylen([1, 2, 7]))
```

**Output** :

```
5
3
```

**Check Your Understanding**

**Q1** : Write a function named `total` that takes a list of integers as input, and returns the total value of all those integers added together.


```python
def total(alist):
	tot = 0
	for number in alist:
		tot += number
	return tot

list_a = [1, 4, 2, 8, 30]
list_b = [3, 2, 9, 7]
```

**Output** :

```
45
21
```

**Q2** : Write a function called `count` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a count of the number of elements in the list.


```python
def count(alist):
	co = 0
	for number in alist:
		co += 1
	return co

list_a = [1, 4, 2, 8, 30]
list_b = [3, 2, 9, 7]

print(count(list_a))
print(count(list_b))
```

**Output** :

```
5
4
```
