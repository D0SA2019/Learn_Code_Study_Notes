## Week 2 : Dictionaries and Dictionary Accumulation
### 2.3. Dictionary Methods

Dictionaries have a number of useful built-in methods. The following table provides a summary and more details can be found in the [Python Documentation](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict).

| Method | Parameters | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `.keys` | none | Returns a view of the keys in the dictionary |
| `.values` | none | Returns a view of the values in the dictionary |
| `.items` | none | Returns a view of the key-value pairs in the dictionary |
| `.get` | key | Returns the value associated with key; None otherwise |
| `.get` | key, alt| Returns the value associated with key; alt otherwise |


As we saw earlier with strings and lists, dictionary methods use dot notation, which specifies the name of the method to the right of the dot and the name of the object on which to apply the method immediately to the left of the dot. The empty parentheses in the case of `keys` indicate that this method takes no parameters. If `x` is a variable whose value is a dictionary, `x.keys` is the method object, and `x.keys()` invokes the method, returning a view of the value.

The keys method returns the keys, not necessarily in the same order they were added to the dictionary or any other particular order.


```python
inventory = {"apples": 430, "bananas": 312, "oranges": 525, "pears": 217}

for akey in inventory.keys():
	print("Got key", akey, "which maps to value", inventory[akey])

ks = list(inventory.keys())
print(ks)
```

**Output** :

```
Got key apples which maps to value 430
Got key bananas which maps to value 312
Got key oranges which maps to value 525
Got key pears which maps to value 217
['apples', 'bananas', 'oranges', 'pears']
```

It’s so common to iterate over the `keys` in a dictionary that you can omit the keys method call in the `for` loop — iterating over a dictionary implicitly iterates over its keys.


```python
inventory = {"apples": 430, "bananas": 312, "oranges": 525, "pears": 217}

for k in inventory:
	print("Got key", k)
```

**Output** :

```
Got key apples
Got key bananas
Got key oranges
Got key pears
```

The `values` and `items` methods are similar to `keys`. They return the objects which can be iterated over. Note that the item objects are tuples containing the key and the associated value.

```python
inventory = {"apples": 430, "bananas": 312, "oranges": 525, "pears": 217}

print(list(inventory.values()))
print(list(inventory.items()))

for k in inventory:
	print("Got", k, "that maps to", inventory[k])
```

**Output** :

```
[430, 312, 525, 217]
[('apples', 430), ('bananas', 312), ('oranges', 525), ('pears', 217)]
Got apples that maps to 430
Got bananas that maps to 312
Got oranges that maps to 525
Got pears that maps to 217
```

**Note** : Technically, `.keys()`, .`values()`, and `.items()` don’t return actual lists. Like the range function described previously, in python 3 they return objects that produce the items one at a time, rather than producing and storing all of them in advance as a list. Unless the dictionary has a whole lot of keys, this won’t make a difference for performance. In any case, as with the range function, it is safe for you to think of them as returning lists, for most purposes. For the python interpreter built into this textbook, they actually do produce lists. In a native python interpreter, if you print out `type(inventory.keys())`, you will find that it is something other than an actual list. If you want to get the first key, `inventory.keys()[0]` works in the online textbook, but in a real python interpreter, you need to make the collection of keys into a real list before using `[0]` to index into it: `list(inventory.keys())[0]`.

The `in` and `not in` operators can test if a key is in the dictionary:


```python
inventory = {"apples": 430, "bananas": 312, "oranges": 525, "pears": 217}

print("apples" in inventory)
print("cherries" in inventory)

if "bananas" in inventory:
	print(inventory["bananas"])
else:
	print("We have no bananas")
```

**Output** :

```
True
False
312
```

This operator can be very useful since looking up a non-existent key in a dictionary causes a runtime error.

The `get` method allows us to access the value associated with a key, similar to the `[ ]` operator. The important difference is that `get` will not cause a runtime error if the key is not present. It will instead return None. There exists a variation of `get` that allows a second parameter that serves as an alternative return value in the case where the key is not present. This can be seen in the final example below. In this case, since “cherries” is not a key, return 0 (instead of None).

```python
inventory = {"apples": 430, "bananas": 312, "oranges": 525, "pears": 217}

print(inventory.get("apples"))
print(inventory.get("cherries"))
print(inventory.get("cherries, 0"))
print(inventory.get("cherries, 999"))
print(inventory)
```

**Output** :

```
430
None
0
999
{'apples': 430, 'bananas': 312, 'oranges': 525, 'pears': 217
```

**Q5** : Every four years, the summer Olympics are held in a different country. Add a key-value pair to the dictionary `places` that reflects that the 2016 Olympics were held in Brazil. Do not rewrite the entire dictionary to do this!



```python
# Given
places = {"Australia":2000, "Greece":2004, "China":2008, "England":2012}


# Solution
places = {"Australia":2000, "Greece":2004, "China":2008, "England":2012}
places["Brazil"] = 2016
print(places)
```

**Output** :

```
{'Australia': 2000, 'Greece': 2004, 'China': 2008, 'England': 2012, 'Brazil': 2016}

**Q6** : We have a dictionary of the specific events that Italy has won medals in and the number of medals they have won for each event. Assign to the variable `events` a list of the keys from the dictionary `medal_events`. Do not hard code this.



```python
# Given
medal_events = {'Shooting': 7, 'Fencing': 4, 'Judo': 2, 'Swimming': 3, 'Diving': 2}


# Solution
medal_events = {'Shooting': 7, 'Fencing': 4, 'Judo': 2, 'Swimming': 3, 'Diving': 2}
events = list(medal_events.keys())
print(events)
```

**Output** :

```
['Shooting', 'Fencing', 'Judo', 'Swimming', 'Diving']
```
