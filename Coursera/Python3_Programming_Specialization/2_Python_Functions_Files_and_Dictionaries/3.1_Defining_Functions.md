## Week 3 : Functions and Tuples
### 3.1. Defining Functions

**Introduction to Functions**

In Python, a function is a chunk of code that performs some operation that is meaningful for a person to think about as a whole unit, for example calculating a student’s GPA in a learning system or responding to the jump action in a video game. Once a function has been defined and you are satisfied that it does what it is supposed to do, you will start thinking about it in terms of the larger operation that it performs rather than the specific lines of code that make it work.

This breaking down of a task or problem is crucial to the successful implementation of any program of more than 50 or so lines (and plenty of smaller ones too). For example, the program that displays the Instagram landing page is made up of functions that:

* display the header bar
* display your friends’ posts
* display your friends’ stories
* display the ad at the bottom of the screen recommending you use the app

And each of those is made up of functions as well. For example, the function that displays your friends’ posts is a for loop that calls a function to:

* display a single post which in turn calls functions to:
* display the photo and name of the person posting the story
* display the photo itself
* display other users’ “likes” to the story
* display the comments on the story
* etc.

In this chapter you will learn about named functions, functions that can be referred to by name when you want to execute them.

#### Defining Functions

The syntax for creating a named function, a **function definition**, is:

```python
def name(parameters):
	statements
```

You can make up any names you want for the functions you create, except that you can’t use a name that is a Python keyword, and the names must follow the rules for legal identifiers that were given previously. The parameters specify what information, if any, you have to provide in order to use the new function. Another way to say this is that the parameters specify what the function needs to do its work.

There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be indented from the def. In the examples in this book, we will use the standard indentation of four spaces. Function definitions are the third of several **compound statements** we will see, all of which have the same pattern:

1. A **header** line which begins with a keyword and ends with a colon.
2. A **body** consisting of one or more Python statements, each indented the same amount – 4 spaces is the Python standard – from the header line.

We’ve already seen the `for` statement which has the same structure, with an indented block of code, and the `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements that do so as well.

In a function definition, the keyword in the header is `def`, which is followed by the name of the function and some parameter names enclosed in parentheses. The parameter list may be empty, or it may contain any number of parameters separated from one another by commas. In either case, the parentheses are required.

We will come back to the parameters in a little while, but first let’s see what happens when a function is executed, using a function without any parameters to illustrate.

Here’s the definition of a simple function, hello.

```python
def hello():
	"""This function says hello and greets you"""
	print("Hello")
	print("Glad to meet you")
```

**docstrings**

If the first thing after the function header is a string (some tools insist that it must be a triple-quoted string), it is called a ***docstring*** and gets special treatment in Python and in some of the programming tools.

Another way to retrieve this information is to use the interactive interpreter, and enter the expression `<function_name>.__doc__`, which will retrieve the docstring for the function. So the string you write as documentation at the start of a function is retrievable by python tools at runtime. This is different from comments in your code, which are completely eliminated when the program is parsed.

By convention, Python programmers use docstrings for the key documentation of their functions.

We can apply functions to the turtle drawings we’ve done in the past as well.

```python
import turtle

def drawSquare(t, sz):
	"""Make turtle t draw a square of with side sz."""

	for i in range(4):
		t.forward(sz)
		t.left(90)

wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")

alex = turtle.Turtle()
alex.speed(1)
drawSquare(alex, 50)

wn.exitonclick()
```


**Output** :

This function is named `drawSquare`. It has two parameters — one to tell the function which turtle to move around and the other to tell it the size of the square we want drawn. In the function definition they are called t and sz respectively. Make sure you know where the body of the function ends — it depends on the indentation and the blank lines don’t count for this purpose!


#### Function Invocation

Defining a new function does not make the function run. To execute the function, we need a **function call**. This is also known as a **function invocation**.

The way to invoke a function is to refer to it by name, followed by parentheses. Since there are no parameters for the function hello, we won’t need to put anything inside the parentheses when we call it. Once we’ve defined a function, we can call it as often as we like and its statements will be executed each time we call it.

```python
def hello():
	print("hello")
	print("Glad to meet you")

print(type(hello))
print(type("hello"))

hello()
print("Hey, that just printed two lines with one line of code!")
hello()
```

**Output**:

```
<class 'function'>
<class 'str'>
hello
Glad to meet you
Hey, that just printed two lines with one line of code!
hello
Glad to meet you
```

Let’s take a closer look at what happens when you define a function and when you execute the function. Try stepping through the code above.

First, note that in Step 1, when it executes line 1, it does not execute lines 2 and 3. Instead, as you can see in blue “Global variables” area, it creates a variable named hello whose value is a python function object. In the diagram that object is labeled hello() with a notation above it that it is a function.

At Step 2, the next line of code to execute is line 5. Just to emphasize that hello is a variable like any other, and that functions are python objects like any other, just of a particular type, line 5 prints out the type of the object referred to by the variable hello. It’s type is officially ‘function’.

Line 6 is just there to remind you of the difference between referring to the variable name (function name) hello and referring to the string “hello”.

At Step 4 we get to line 8, which has an invocation of the function. The way function invocation works is that the code block inside the function definition is executed in the usual way, but at the end, execution jumps to the point after the function invocation.

You can see that by following the next few steps. At Step 5, the red arrow has moved to line 2, which will execute next. We say that control has passed from the top-level program to the function hello. After Steps 5 and 6 print out two lines, at Step 7, control will be passed back to the point after where the invocation was started. At Step 8, that has happened.

The same process of invocation occurs again on line 10, with lines 2 and 3 getting executed a second time.

**Common Mistake with Functions**

It is a common mistake for beginners to forget their parenthesis after the function name. This is particularly common in the case where there parameters are not required. Because the hello function defined above does not require parameters, it’s easy to forget the parenthesis. This is less common, but still possible, when trying to call functions that require parameters.
