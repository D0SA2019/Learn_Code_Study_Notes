## Week 3 : Functions and Tuples
### 3.7. Function Composition

It is important to understand that each of the functions we write can be used and called from other functions we write. This is one of the most important ways that computer programmers take a large problem and break it down into a group of smaller problems. This process of breaking a problem into smaller subproblems is called **functional decomposition**.

Here’s a simple example of functional decomposition using two functions. The first function called `square` simply computes the square of a given number. The second function called `sum_of_squares` makes use of square to compute the sum of three numbers that have been squared.


```python
def square(x):
	y = x * x
	return y

def sum_of_squares(x, y, z):
	a = square(x)
	b = square(y)
	c = square(z)

	return a + b + c

a = -5
b = 2
c = 10

result = sum_of_squares(a, b, c)
print(result)
```

**Output** :

```
129
```

Even though this is a pretty simple idea, in practice this example illustrates many very important Python concepts, including local and global variables along with parameter passing. Note that the body of `square` is not executed until it is called from inside the `sum_of_squares` function for the first time on line 6.

Also notice that when `square` is called (at Step 8, for example), there are two groups of local variables, one for `square` and one for `sum_of_squares`. Each group of local variables is called a **stack frame**. The variables `x`, and `y` are local variables in both functions. These are completely different variables, even though they have the same name. Each function invocation creates a new frame, and variables are looked up in that frame. Notice that at step 9, y has the value 25 is one frame and 2 in the other.

What happens when you to refer to variable y on line 3? Python looks up the value of y in the stack frame for the `square` function. If it didn’t find it there, it would go look in the global frame.

Let’s use composition to build up a little more useful function. Recall from the dictionaries chapter that we had a two-step process for finding the letter that appears most frequently in a text string:

1. Accumulate a dictionary with letters as keys and counts as values. See [example](https://github.com/hevalhazalkurt/Learn_Code_Study_Notes/blob/master/Coursera/Python3_Programming_Specialization/2_Python_Functions_Files_and_Dictionaries/2.5_Dictionary_Accumulation.md).
2. Find the best key from that dictionary. See [example](https://github.com/hevalhazalkurt/Learn_Code_Study_Notes/blob/master/Coursera/Python3_Programming_Specialization/2_Python_Functions_Files_and_Dictionaries/2.6_Accumulating_Results_From_a_Dictionary.md).

We can make functions for each of those and then compose them into a single function that finds the most common letter.

```python
def most_common_letter(s):
	frequencies = count_freqs(s)
	return best_key(frequencies)

def count_freqs(st):
	d = {}
	for c in st:
		if c not in d:
			d[c] = 0
		d[c] = d[c] + 1

	return d

def best_key(dictionary):
	ks = dictionary.keys()
	best_key_so_far = list(ks)[0]
	for k in ks:
		if dictionary[k] > dictionary[best_key_so_far]:
			best_key_so_far = k
	return best_key_so_far

print(most_common_letter("abbbbbbbbbbbbbbcccddddd"))
```

**Output** :

```
b
```

#### Flow of Execution Summary

When you are working with functions it is really important to know the order in which statements are executed. This is called the **flow of execution** and we’ve already talked about it a number of times in this chapter.

Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one at a time, in order, from top to bottom. Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called. Function calls are like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the first line of the called function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.

That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another function. But while executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet another function!

Fortunately, the Python interperter is adept at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.

What does all that mean for us when we try to understand a program? Don’t read from top to bottom. Instead, follow the flow of execution. This means that you will read the def statements as you are scanning from top to bottom, but you should skip the body of the function until you reach a point where that function is called.

**Check Your Understanding**

**Q1** : Write two functions, one called `addit` and one called `mult`. `addit` takes one number as an input and adds 5. `mult` takes one number as an input, and multiplies that input by whatever is returned by `addit`, and then returns the result.

```python
def addit(n):
	return n + 5

def mult(s):
	return s * addit(s)

print(mult(7))
```

**Output** :

```
84
```
