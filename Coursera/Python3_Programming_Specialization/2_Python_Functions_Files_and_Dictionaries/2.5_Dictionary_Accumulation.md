## Week 2 : Dictionaries and Dictionary Accumulation
### 2.5. Dictionary Accumulation


You have previously seen the accumulator pattern; it goes through the items in a sequence, updating an accumulator variable each time. Rather than accumulating a single result, it’s possible to accumulate many results. Suppose, for example, we wanted to find out which letters are used most frequently in English.

Suppose we had a reasonably long text that we thought was representative of general English usage. For our purposes in the this chapter, we will use the text of the Sherlock Holmes story, “A Study in Scarlet”, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The text actually includes a few lines about the source of the transcription (Project Gutenberg), but those will not materially affect our analyses so we will just leave them in. You can access this text within this chapter with the code `open('scarlet.txt', 'r')`.


If we want to find out how often the letter ‘t’ occurs, we can accumulate the result in a count variable.


```python
f = open("scarlet.txt", "r")
txt = f.read()

t_count = 0
for c in txt:
	if c == "t":
		t_count = t_count + 1
print("t: " + str(t_count) + " occurrences")
```

**Output** :

```
t: 15946 occurrences
```

We can accumulate counts for more than one character as we traverse the text. Suppose, for example, we wanted to compare the counts of ‘t’ and ‘s’ in the text.


```python
f = open("scarlet.txt", "r")
txt = f.read()

t_count = 0
s_count = 0

for c in txt:
	if c == "t":
		t_count = t_count + 1
	elif c == "s":
		s_count = s_count + 1

print("t: " + str(t_count) + " occurrences")
print("s: " + str(s_count) + " occurrences")
```

**Output** :

```
t: 15946 occurrences
s: 11047 occurrences
```

OK, but you can see this is going to get tedious if we try to accumulate counts for all the letters. We will have to initialize a lot of accumulators, and there will be a very long if..elif..elif statement. Using a dictionary, we can do a lot better.

One dictionary can hold all of the accumulator variables. Each key in the dictionary will be one letter, and the corresponding value will be the count so far of how many times that letter has occurred.


```python
f = open("scarlet.txt", "r")
txt = f.read()

x = {}
x["t"] = 0
x["s"] = 0

for c in txt:
	if c == "t":
		x["t"] = x["t"] + 1
	elif c == "s":
		x["s"] = x["s"] + 1

print("t: " + str(x["t"]) + " occurrences")
print("s: " + str(x["s"]) + " occurrences")
```

**Output** :

```
t: 15946 occurrences
s: 11047 occurrences
```

This hasn’t really improved things yet, but look closely at lines 8-11 in the code above. Whichever character we’re seeing, t or s, we’re incrementing the counter for that character. So lines 9 and 11 could really be the same.


```python
f = open("scarlet.txt", "r")
txt = f.read()

x = {}
x['t'] = 0  
x['s'] = 0
for c in txt:
    if c == 't':
        x[c] = x[c] + 1
    elif c == 's':
        x[c] = x[c] + 1

print("t: " + str(x['t']) + " occurrences")
print("s: " + str(x['s']) + " occurrences")
```

**Output** :

```
t: 15946 occurrences
s: 11047 occurrences
```

Lines 9 and 11 above may seem a little confusing at first. Previously, our assignment statements referred directly to keys, with `x['s']` and `x['t']`. Here we are just using a variable `c` whose value is ‘s’ or ‘t’, or some other character.

If that made perfect sense to you, skip the next two paragraphs. Otherwise, read on. Let’s break down that line in a little more detail.

First, note that, as with all assignment statements, the right side is evaluated first. In this case `x[c]` has to be evaluated. As with all expressions, we first have to substitute values for variable names. `x` is a variable bound to a dictionary. `c` is a variable bound to one letter from the string that `txt` is bound to (that’s what the for statement says to do: execute lines 8-11 once for each character in txt, with the variable c bound to the current character on each iteration.) So, let’s suppose that the current character is the letter `s` (we are on line 11). Then `x[c]` looks up the value associated with the key ‘s’ in the dictionary x. If all is working correctly, that value should be the number of times ‘s’ has previously occurred. For the sake of argument, suppose it’s 25. Then the right side evaluates to 25 + 1, 26.

Now we have assigned the value 26 to `x[c]`. That is, in dictionary x, we set the value associated with the key ‘s’ (the current value of the variable c) to be 26. In other words, we have incremented the value associated with the key ‘s’ from 25 to 26.

We can do better still. One other nice thing about using a dictionary is that we don’t have to prespecify what all the letters will be. In this case, we know in advance what the alphabet for English is, but later in the chapter we will count the occurrences of words, and we do not know in advance all the of the words that may be used. Rather than pre-specifying which letters to keep accumulator counts for, we can start with an empty dictionary and add a counter to the dictionary each time we encounter a new thing that we want to start keeping count of.

```python
f = open("scarlet.txt", "r")
txt = f.read()

x = {}
for c in txt:
	if c not in x:
		x[c] = 0

	x[c] = x[c] + 1

print("t: " + str(x['t']) + " occurrences")
print("s: " + str(x['s']) + " occurrences")
print(x)
```

**Output** :

```
t: 15946 occurrences
s: 11047 occurrences
{'P': 72, 'a': 14830, 'r': 10862, 't': 15946, ' ': 42642, 'O': 101, 'n': 12598, 'e': 23485, ':': 31, 'S': 290, 'u': 5155, 'd': 8457, 'y': 3399, 'i': 11589, 'c': 4492, 'l': 6952, 'B': 115, 'g': 3673, 'R': 60, 'p': 2963, 'f': 3882, 'o': 14062, 'm': 4728, 'h': 12317, 's': 11047, 'J': 110, 'H': 477, '.': 2412, 'W': 268, ',': 2959, 'M': 163, 'D': 147, 'L': 181, 'A': 261, '\n': 1645, 'C': 129, '1': 18, 'k': 1348, 'I': 1209, '8': 5, '7': 5, 'U': 27, 'v': 1786, 'N': 138, 'b': 2477, 'w': 4492, 'F': 109, 'T': 526, 'j': 127, "'": 461, 'z': 108, 'G': 111, '-': 259, 'E': 83, '"': 1697, 'x': 290, '—': 116, 'q': 137, '?': 208, 'Y': 162, '!': 85, ';': 100, 'V': 11, 'æ': 1, '2': 14, 'K': 10, '4': 9, 'Q': 1, '3': 12, '9': 3, '6': 7, '5': 3, '0': 2, ']': 2, 'ñ': 4, 'Z': 2, '[': 1, '^': 1, 'é': 1, '(': 1, ')': 1}
```

Notice that in the for loop, we no longer need to explicitly ask whether the current letter is an ‘s’ or ‘t’. The increment step on line 11 works for the counter associated with whatever the current character is. Our code is now accumulating counts for all letters, not just ‘s’ and ‘t’.

Note that the print statements at the end pick out the specific keys ‘t’ and ‘s’. We can generalize that, too, to print out the occurrence counts for all of the characters, using a for loop to iterate through the keys in x.

```python
f = open('scarlet.txt', 'r')
txt = f.read()

letter_counts = {}
for c in txt:
	if c not in letter_counts:
		letter_counts[c] = 0
	letter_counts[c] = letter_counts[c] + 1

for c in letter_counts.keys():
	print(c + ": " + str(letter_counts[c]) + " occurrences")

print(letter_counts)
```

Note that only those letters that actually occur in the text are shown. Some punctuation marks that are possible in English, but were never used in the text, are omitted completely. The blank line partway through the output may surprise you. That’s actually saying that the newline character, `\\n`, appears 1645 times in the text. In other words, there are 1645 lines of text in the file. Let’s test that hypothesis.

```python
f = open("scarlet.txt", "r")
txt_lines = f.readlines()

print(len(txt_lines))
print(txt_lines[70:85])
```

**Output** :

```

['"No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him." As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\n', '\n', 'This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure, "I have found it! I have found it," he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand. "I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin, and by nothing else."

"Let us have some fresh blood," he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. "Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction." As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid.

**Q2** : Provided is a string saved to the variable name `sentence`. Split the string into a list of words, then create a dictionary that contains each word and the number of times it occurs. Save this dictionary to the variable name `word_counts`.

```python
# Given
sentence = "The dog chased the rabbit into the forest but the rabbit was too quick."



# Solution
sentence = "The dog chased the rabbit into the forest but the rabbit was too quick."
lst = sentence.split()
word_counts = {}

for word in lst:
	if word not in word_counts:
		word_counts[word] = 0
	word_counts[word] += 1

print(word_counts)
```

**Output** :

```
{'The': 1, 'dog': 1, 'chased': 1, 'the': 3, 'rabbit': 2, 'into': 1, 'forest': 1, 'but': 1, 'was': 1, 'too': 1, 'quick.': 1}
```

# Solution
stri = "what can I do"
char_d = {}

for char in stri:
	if char not in char_d:
		char_d[char] = 0
	char_d[char] += 1

print(char_d)
```

**Output** :

```
{'w': 1, 'h': 1, 'a': 2, 't': 1, ' ': 3, 'c': 1, 'n': 1, 'I': 1, 'd': 1, 'o': 1}
