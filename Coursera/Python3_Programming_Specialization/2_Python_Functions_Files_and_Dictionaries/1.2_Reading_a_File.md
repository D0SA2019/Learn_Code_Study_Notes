# Python Functions, Files, and Dictionaries
*Coursera | Python 3 Programming Specialization | Course 2*

## Week 1 : Files and CSV Output
### 1.2. Reading a File

As an example, suppose we have a text file called `olympics.txt` that contains the data representing about olympians across different years. The contents of the file are shown at the bottom of the page.

To open this file, we would call the `open` function. The variable, `fileref`, now holds a reference to the file object returned by `open`. When we are finished with the file, we can close it by using the `close` method. After the file is closed any further attempts to use `fileref` will result in an error.

```python
fileref = open("olympics.txt", "r")
fileref.close()
```


**Note** : A common mistake is to get confused about whether you are providing a variable name or a string literal as an input to the open function. In the code above, “olympics.txt” is a string literal that should correspond to the name of a file on your computer. If you put something without quotes, like `open(x, "r")`, it will be treated as a variable name. In this example, x should be a variable that’s already been bound to a string value like “olympics.txt”.


#### Alternative File Reading Methods

Once you have a file “object”, the thing returned by the open function, Python provides three methods to read data from that object. The `read()` method returns the entire contents of the file as a single string (or just some characters if you provide a number as an input parameter. The `readlines` method returns the entire contents of the entire file as a list of strings, where each item in the list is one line of the file. The `readline` method reads one line from the file and returns it as a string. The strings returned by `readlines` or `readline` will contain the newline character at the end. Table 2 summarizes these methods and the following session shows them in action.


| Method Name | Use | Explanation |
|--|--|--|
| `write` | `filevar.write(astring)` | Add astring to the end of the file. filevar must refer to a file that has been opened for writing. |
| `read(n)` | `filevar.read()` | Reads and returns a string of n characters, or the entire file as a single string if `n` is not provided. |
| `readline(n)` | `filevar.readline()` | Returns the next line of the file with all text up to and including the newline character. If n is provided as a parameter than only n characters will be returned if the line is longer than `n`. |
| `readlines(n)` | `filevar.readlines()` | Returns a list of strings, each representing a single line of the file. If n is not provided then all lines of the file are returned. If n is provided then n characters are read but n is rounded up so that an entire line is returned. |

In this course, we will generally either iterate through the lines returned by `readlines()` with a for loop, or use `read()` to get all of the contents as a single string.

In other programming languages, where they don’t have the convenient for loop method of going through the lines of the file one by one, they use a different pattern which requires a different kind of loop, the `while` loop. Fortunately, you don’t need to learn this other pattern, and we will put off consideration of `while` loops until later in this course. We don’t need them for handling data from files.


**Note**: A common error that novice programmers make is not realizing that all these ways of reading the file contents, use up the file. After you call `readlines()`, if you call it again you’ll get an empty list.


**Reading all content**

```python
ol_file = open("olympics.txt", "r")
print(ol_file)

contents_full = ol_file.read()
print(contents_full)
```

#### Iterating over lines in a file

We will now use this file as input in a program that will do some data processing. In the program, we will examine each line of the file and print it with some additional text. Because `readlines()` returns a list of lines of text, we can use the for loop to iterate through each line of the file.

A line of a file is defined to be a sequence of characters up to and including a special character called the newline character. If you evaluate a string that contains a newline character you will see the character represented as `\n`. If you print a string that contains a newline you will not see the `\n`, you will just see its effects (a carriage return).

As the for loop iterates through each line of the file the loop variable will contain the current line of the file as a string of characters. The general pattern for processing each line of a text file is as follows:

```python
for line in myFile.readlines():
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
```

To process all of our olypmics data, we will use a for loop to iterate over the lines of the file. Using the `split` method, we can break each line into a list containing all the fields of interest about the athlete. We can then take the values corresponding to name, team and event to construct a simple sentence.


```python
olympicsfile = open("olympics.txt","r")
for aline in olympicsfile.readlines():
  values = aline.split(",")
  print(values[0], "is from", values[3], "and is on the roster for", values[4])
olympicsfile.close()
```

**Output** :

To make the code a little simpler, and to allow for more efficient processing, Python provides a built-in way to iterate through the contents of a file one line at a time, without first reading them all into a list. Some students find this confusing initially, so we don’t recommend doing it this way, until you get a little more comfortable with Python. But this idiom is preferred by Python programmers, so you should be prepared to read it. And when you start dealing with big files, you may notice the efficiency gains of using it.

```python
olympicsfile = open("olympics.txt","r")

for aline in olympicsfile:
  values = aline.split(",")
  print(values[0], "is from", values[3], "and is on the roster for", values[4])
olympicsfile.close()
```

**Output** :

```
Name is from Team and is on the roster for Event

**Check Your Understanding**

**E1** : Using the file `school_prompt2.txt`, find the number of characters in the file and assign that value to the variable `num_char`.

```python
sc_file = open("school_prompt2.txt", "r")
num_char = len(sc_file.read())
print(num_char)
```

**Output** :

```
536

**E4** : Write code to find out how many lines are in the file `emotion_words.txt`. Save this value to the variable `num_lines`. Do not use the len method.

num_lines = 0

for line in em_file:
    num_lines +=1
