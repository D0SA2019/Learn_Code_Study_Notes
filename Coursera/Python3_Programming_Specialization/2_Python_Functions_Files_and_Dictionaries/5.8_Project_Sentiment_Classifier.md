## Week 5 : Sorting
### 5.8. Project - Sentiment Classifier

We have provided some synthetic (fake, semi-randomly generated) twitter data in a csv file named project_twitter_data.csv which has the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet. We have also words that express positive sentiment and negative sentiment, in the files positive_words.txt and negative_words.txt.

Your task is to build a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is. You will create a csv file, which contains columns for the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score (which is how many happy words are in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), and the Net Score for each tweet. At the end, you upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets, and produce a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets.

To start, define a function called `strip_punctuation` which takes one parameter, a string which represents a word, and removes characters considered punctuation from everywhere in the word. (Hint: remember the .replace() method for strings.)


```python
# Given
punctuation_chars = ["'", '"', ",", ".", "!", ":", ";", '#', '@']



# Solution
def strip_punctuation(atext):
    for punc in punctuation_chars:
        if punc in atext:
            atext = atext.replace(punc, "")
    return atext

print(strip_punctuation('#Amazing'))
print(strip_punctuation('wow'))
print(strip_punctuation('incredible'))
print(strip_punctuation('wonderful'))
```

**Output** :

```
Amazing
wow
incredible
wonderful
```

Next, copy in your strip_punctuation function and define a function called `get_pos` which takes one parameter, a string which represents a one or more sentences, and calculates how many words in the string are considered positive words. Use the list, `positive_words` to determine what words will count as positive. The function should return a positive integer - how many occurances there are of positive words in the text.

```python
# Given
punctuation_chars = ["'", '"', ",", ".", "!", ":", ";", '#', '@']
# list of positive words to use
positive_words = []
with open("positive_words.txt") as pos_f:
    for lin in pos_f:
        if lin[0] != ';' and lin[0] != '\n':
            positive_words.append(lin.strip())



# Solution
def strip_punctuation(atext):
    for punc in punctuation_chars:
        if punc in atext:
            atext = atext.replace(punc, "")
    return atext

def get_pos(astring):
    astring= strip_punctuation(astring)
    astring = astring.lower()
    words = astring.split()
    print(words)
    tot = 0
    for word in words:
        if word in positive_words:
            tot += 1
    return tot

positives = {}
punctuation_chars = ["'", '"', ",", ".", "!", ":", ";", '#', '@']
# list of positive words to use
positive_words = []
with open("positive_words.txt") as pos_f:
    for lin in pos_f:
        if lin[0] != ';' and lin[0] != '\n':
            positive_words.append(lin.strip())
```

Next, copy in your `strip_punctuation` function and define a function called `get_neg` which takes one parameter, a string which represents a one or more sentences, and calculates how many words in the string are considered negative words. Use the list, `negative_words` to determine what words will count as negative. The function should return a positive integer - how many occurances there are of negative words in the text.

```python
# Given
punctuation_chars = ["'", '"', ",", ".", "!", ":", ";", '#', '@']

negative_words = []
with open("negative_words.txt") as pos_f:
    for lin in pos_f:
        if lin[0] != ';' and lin[0] != '\n':
            negative_words.append(lin.strip())


# Solution
def strip_punctuation(atext):
    for punc in punctuation_chars:
        if punc in atext:
            atext = atext.replace(punc, "")
    return atext

def get_neg(astring):
    astring= strip_punctuation(astring)
    astring = astring.lower()
    words = astring.split()
    print(words)
    tot = 0
    for word in words:
        if word in negative_words:
            tot += 1
    return tot

punctuation_chars = ["'", '"', ",", ".", "!", ":", ";", '#', '@']

negative_words = []
with open("negative_words.txt") as pos_f:
    for lin in pos_f:
        if lin[0] != ';' and lin[0] != '\n':
            negative_words.append(lin.strip())
```

Finally, copy in your previous functions and write code that opens the file `project_twitter_data.csv` which has the fake generated twitter data (the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet). Your task is to build a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is. Copy the code from the code windows above, and put that in the top of this code window. Now, you will write code to create a csv file called `resulting_data.csv`, which contains the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score (which is how many happy words are in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), and the Net Score (how positive or negative the text is overall) for each tweet. The file should have those headers in that order. Remember that there is another component to this project. You will upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets and produce a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets.

			pass
		else:
			negative = get_neg(tweet)
			positive = get_pos(tweet)
			score = positive - negative
			tweet = tweet.strip().split(",")
			tweet_text, retweets, replies = tweet[0], tweet[1], tweet[2]
			res = "{},{},{},{},{}\n".format(retweets, replies, positive, negative, score)
			result_file.write(res)
