## Week 2 : Dictionaries and Dictionary Accumulation
### 2.6. Accumulating Results From a Dictionary

Just as we have iterated through the elements of a list to accumulate a result, we can also iterate through the keys in a dictionary, accumulating a result that may depend on the values associated with each of the keys.

For example, suppose that we wanted to compute a Scrabble score for the Study in Scarlet text. Each occurrence of the letter ‘e’ earns one point, but ‘q’ earns 10. We have a second dictionary, stored in the variable `letter_values`. Now, to compute the total score, we start an accumulator at 0 and go through each of the letters in the counts dictionary. For each of those letters that has a letter value (no points for spaces, punctuation, capital letters, etc.), we add to the total score.


```python
f = open("scarlet.txt", "r")
txt = f.read()

x = {}
for c in txt:
	if c not in x:
		x[c] = 0
	x[c] = x[c] + 1

letter_values = {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 3, 'd': 2, 'e': 1, 'f':4, 'g': 2, 'h':4, 'i':1, 'j':8, 'k':5, 'l':1, 'm':3, 'n':1, 'o':1, 'p':3, 'q':10, 'r':1, 's':1, 't':1, 'u':1, 'v':8, 'w':4, 'x':8, 'y':4, 'z':10}

tot = 0
for y in x:
	if y in letter_values:
		tot = tot + letter_values[y] * x[y]

print(tot)
print(letter_values)
```

**Output** :

```
317940
```

Line 18 is the tricky one. We are updating the variable tot to have its old number plus the score for the current letter times the number of occurrences of that letter. Try changing some of the letter values and see how it affects the total. Try changing txt to be just a single word that you might play in Scrabble.

**Check Your Understanding**

**Q1** : The dictionary `travel` contains the number of countries within each continent that Jackie has traveled to. Find the total number of countries that Jackie has been to, and save this number to the variable name `total`. Do not hard code this!


```python
# Given
travel = {"North America": 2, "Europe": 8, "South America": 3, "Asia": 4, "Africa":1, "Antarctica": 0, "Australia": 1}



# Solution
travel = {"North America": 2, "Europe": 8, "South America": 3, "Asia": 4, "Africa":1, "Antarctica": 0, "Australia": 1}
total = 0

for v in travel:
	total = total + travel[v]
print(total)
```

**Output** :

```
19
```

**Q2** : Write a program that finds the key in a dictionary that has the maximum value. If two keys have the same maximum value, it’s OK to print out either one. Fill in the skeleton code


```python
# Given
d = {'a': 194, 'b': 54, 'c':34, 'd': 44, 'e': 312, 'full':31}

ks = d.keys()
# initialize variable best_key_so_far to be the first key in d
for k in ks:
    # check if the value associated with the current key is
    # bigger than the value associated with the best_key_so_far
    # if so, save the current key as the best so far

print("key " + best_key_so_far + " has the highest value, " + str(d[best_key_so_far]))



# Solution
d = {'a': 194, 'b': 54, 'c':34, 'd': 44, 'e': 312, 'full':31}

ks = d.keys()
big_number = None
best_key_so_far = None
for k in ks:
	if big_number == None:
		big_number = d[k]
		best_key_so_far = k
	elif d[k] >= big_number :
		big_number = d[k]
		best_key_so_far = k
	else:
		pass

print("key " + best_key_so_far + " has the highest value, " + str(d[best_key_so_far]))
```

**Output** :

```
key e has the highest value, 312
```

**Q3** : Create a dictionary called `d` that keeps track of all the characters in the string `placement` and notes how many times each character was seen. Then, find the key with the lowest value in this dictionary and assign that key to `min_value`.


```python
# Given
placement = "Beaches are cool places to visit in spring however the Mackinaw Bridge is near. Most people visit Mackinaw later since the island is a cool place to explore."



# Solution
placement = "Beaches are cool places to visit in spring however the Mackinaw Bridge is near. Most people visit Mackinaw later since the island is a cool place to explore."
d = {}
min_val = None
min_value = None

for char in placement:
	if char not in d:
		d[char] = 0
	d[char] += 1

print(d)

for key in d:
	if min_val == None:
		min_val = d[key]
		min_value = key
	elif d[key] < min_val:
		min_val = d[key]
		min_value = key
	else:
		pass

print(min_value)
```

**Output** :

```
{'B': 2, 'e': 17, 'a': 12, 'c': 8, 'h': 4, 's': 10, ' ': 27, 'r': 7, 'o': 10, 'l': 8, 'p': 6, 't': 8, 'v': 3, 'i': 13, 'n': 7, 'g': 2, 'w': 3, 'M': 3, 'k': 2, 'd': 2, '.': 2, 'x': 1}
x
```

**Q4** : Create a dictionary called `lett_d` that keeps track of all of the characters in the string `product` and notes how many times each character was seen. Then, find the key with the highest value in this dictionary and assign that key to `max_value`.


```python
# Given
product = "iphone and android phones"


# Solution
product = "iphone and android phones"
lett_d = {}
max_value = None
value = None

for char in product:
	if char not in lett_d:
		lett_d[char] = 0
	lett_d[char] += 1

print(lett_d)

for key in lett_d:
	if value == None:
		value = lett_d[key]
		max_value = key
	elif value <= lett_d[key]:
		value = lett_d[key]
		max_value = key
print(value)
print(max_value)
```

**Output** :

```
{'i': 2, 'p': 2, 'h': 2, 'o': 3, 'n': 4, 'e': 2, ' ': 3, 'a': 2, 'd': 3, 'r': 1, 's': 1}

**Q5** : `schedule` is a dictionary where a class name is a key and its value is how many credits it was worth. Go through and accumulate the total number of credits that have been earned so far and assign that to the variable `total_credits`. Do not hardcode.


```python
# Given
schedule = {"UARTS 150": 3, "SPANISH 103": 4, "ENGLISH 125": 4, "SI 110": 4, "ENS 356": 2, "WOMENSTD 240": 4, "SI 106": 4, "BIO 118": 3, "SPANISH 231": 4, "PSYCH 111": 4, "LING 111": 3, "SPANISH 232": 4, "STATS 250": 4, "SI 206": 4, "COGSCI 200": 4, "AMCULT 202": 4, "ANTHRO 101": 4}


# Solution
schedule = {"UARTS 150": 3, "SPANISH 103": 4, "ENGLISH 125": 4, "SI 110": 4, "ENS 356": 2, "WOMENSTD 240": 4, "SI 106": 4, "BIO 118": 3, "SPANISH 231": 4, "PSYCH 111": 4, "LING 111": 3, "SPANISH 232": 4, "STATS 250": 4, "SI 206": 4, "COGSCI 200": 4, "AMCULT 202": 4, "ANTHRO 101": 4}

total_credits = 0

for k in schedule:
	total_credits += schedule[k]

print(total_credits)
```

**Output** :

```
63
```
