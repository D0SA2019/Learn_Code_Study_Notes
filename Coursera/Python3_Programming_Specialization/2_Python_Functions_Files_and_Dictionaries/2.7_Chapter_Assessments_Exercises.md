## Week 2 : Dictionaries and Dictionary Accumulation
### 2.7. Chapter Assessments & Exercises

#### Assessments

**A1**. At the halfway point during the Rio Olympics, the United States had 70 medals, Great Britain had 38 medals, China had 45 medals, Russia had 30 medals, and Germany had 17 medals. Create a dictionary assigned to the variable `medal_count` with the country names as the keys and the number of medals the country had as each key’s value.


```python
medal_count = {"United States": 70, "Great Britain": 38, "China": 45, "Russia": 30, "Germany": 17}
print(medal_count)
```

**Output** :

```
{'United States': 70, 'Great Britain': 38, 'China': 45, 'Russia': 30, 'Germany': 17}
```

-----

**A2**. Given the dictionary `swimmers`, add an additional key-value pair to the dictionary with `"Phelps"` as the key and the integer `23` as the value. Do not rewrite the entire dictionary.

```python
# Given
swimmers = {'Manuel':4, 'Lochte':12, 'Adrian':7, 'Ledecky':5, 'Dirado':4}


# Solution
swimmers = {'Manuel':4, 'Lochte':12, 'Adrian':7, 'Ledecky':5, 'Dirado':4}
swimmers["Phelps"] = 23
print(swimmers)
```

**Output** :

```
{'Manuel': 4, 'Lochte': 12, 'Adrian': 7, 'Ledecky': 5, 'Dirado': 4, 'Phelps': 23}
```

-----

**A3**. Add the string “hockey” as a key to the dictionary `sports_periods` and assign it the value of 3. Do not rewrite the entire dictionary.

```python
# Given
sports_periods = {'baseball': 9, 'basketball': 4, 'soccer': 4, 'cricket': 2}


# Solution
sports_periods = {'baseball': 9, 'basketball': 4, 'soccer': 4, 'cricket': 2}
sports_periods["hockey"]=3
print(sports_periods)
```

**Output** :

```
{'baseball': 9, 'basketball': 4, 'soccer': 4, 'cricket': 2, 'hockey': 3}
```

-----

**A4**. The dictionary `golds` contains information about how many gold medals each country won in the 2016 Olympics. But today, Spain won 2 more gold medals. Update `golds` to reflect this information.

```python
# Given
golds = {"Italy": 12, "USA": 33, "Brazil": 15, "China": 27, "Spain": 19, "Canada": 22, "Argentina": 8, "England": 29}


# Solution
golds = {"Italy": 12, "USA": 33, "Brazil": 15, "China": 27, "Spain": 19, "Canada": 22, "Argentina": 8, "England": 29}
golds["Spain"] += 2
print(golds["Spain"])
```

**Output** :

```
21
```

-----


**A3**. Add the string “hockey” as a key to the dictionary `sports_periods` and assign it the value of 3. Do not rewrite the entire dictionary.

```python
# Given
sports_periods = {'baseball': 9, 'basketball': 4, 'soccer': 4, 'cricket': 2}


# Solution
sports_periods = {'baseball': 9, 'basketball': 4, 'soccer': 4, 'cricket': 2}
sports_periods["hockey"]=3
print(sports_periods)
```

**Output** :

```
{'baseball': 9, 'basketball': 4, 'soccer': 4, 'cricket': 2, 'hockey': 3}
```

-----

**A5**.  Create a list of the countries that are in the dictionary `golds`, and assign that list to the variable name `countries`. Do not hard code this.

```python
# Given
golds = {"Italy": 12, "USA": 33, "Brazil": 15, "China": 27, "Spain": 19, "Canada": 22, "Argentina": 8, "England": 29}


# Solution
golds = {"Italy": 12, "USA": 33, "Brazil": 15, "China": 27, "Spain": 19, "Canada": 22, "Argentina": 8, "England": 29}
countries = list(golds.keys())

```

**Output** :

```
13
```

-----


**A7**. Provided is a dictionary called `US_medals` which has the first 70 metals that the United States has won in 2016, and in which category they have won it in. Using dictionary mechanics, assign the value of the key `"Fencing`" to a variable `fencing_value`. Remember, do not hard code this.

print(fencing_value)
```

**Output** :

```
4
```

-----

**A8**. The dictionary `Junior` shows a schedule for a junior year semester. The key is the course name and the value is the number of credits. Find the total number of credits taken this semester and assign it to the variable `credits`. Do not hardcode this – use dictionary accumulation!


```python
# Given
Junior = {'SI 206':4, 'SI 310':4, 'BL 300':3, 'TO 313':3, 'BCOM 350':1, 'MO 300':3}

Junior = {'SI 206':4, 'SI 310':4, 'BL 300':3, 'TO 313':3, 'BCOM 350':1, 'MO 300':3}
credits = 0

for k in Junior:
    credits += Junior[k]
print(credits)
```

**Output** :

```
18
```

-----

**A9**. Create a dictionary, `freq`, that displays each character in string `str1` as the key and its frequency as the value.


```python
# Given
str1 = "peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers"


# Solution
str1 = "peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers"
freq = {}

for char in str1:
	if char not in freq:
		freq[char] = 0
	freq[char] += 1
print(freq)
```

**Output** :

```
{'p': 9, 'e': 8, 't': 1, 'r': 3, ' ': 7, 'i': 3, 'c': 3, 'k': 3, 'd': 2, 'a': 1, 'o': 1, 'f': 1, 'l': 1, 's': 1}
```

-----

**A10**. Provided is a string saved to the variable name `s1`. Create a dictionary named `counts` that contains each letter in `s1` and the number of times it occurs.


```python
# Given
s1 = "hello"


# Solution
s1 = "hello"
counts = {}

for char in s1:
	if char not in counts:
		counts[char] = 0
	counts[char] += 1

print(counts)
```

**Output** :

```
{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}
```

-----
-----

**A11**. Create a dictionary, `freq_words`, that displays each word in string `str1` as the key and its frequency as the value.


```python
# Given
str1 = "I wish I wish with all my heart to fly with dragons in a land apart"


# Solution
str1 = "I wish I wish with all my heart to fly with dragons in a land apart"
freq_words = {}

for word in str1.split():
	if word not in freq_words:
		freq_words[word] = 0
	freq_words[word] += 1

print(freq_words)
```

**Output** :

```
{'I': 2, 'wish': 2, 'with': 2, 'all': 1, 'my': 1, 'heart': 1, 'to': 1, 'fly': 1, 'dragons': 1, 'in': 1, 'a': 1, 'land': 1, 'apart': 1}
```

-----

**A12**. Create a dictionary called `wrd_d` from the string `sent`, so that the key is a word and the value is how many times you have seen that word.


```python
# Given
sent = "Singing in the rain and playing in the rain are two entirely different situations but both can be good"


# Solution
sent = "Singing in the rain and playing in the rain are two entirely different situations but both can be good"
wrd_d = {}

for word in sent.split():
	if word not in wrd_d:
		wrd_d[word] = 0
	wrd_d[word] += 1
print(wrd_d)
```

**Output** :

```
{'Singing': 1, 'in': 2, 'the': 2, 'rain': 2, 'and': 1, 'playing': 1, 'are': 1, 'two': 1, 'entirely': 1, 'different': 1, 'situations': 1, 'but': 1, 'both': 1, 'can': 1, 'be': 1, 'good': 1}
```

-----


**A13**. Create the dictionary `characters` that shows each character from the string `sally` and its frequency. Then, find the most frequent letter based on the dictionary. Assign this letter to the variable `best_char`.


```python
# Given
sally = "sally sells sea shells by the sea shore"


# Solution
sally = "sally sells sea shells by the sea shore"
characters = {}
best_char = None

for c in sally:
	if c not in characters:
		characters[c] = 0
	characters[c] += 1

for i in list(characters.keys()):
	if best_char == None:
		best_char = i
	else:
		if characters[i] >= characters[best_char]:
			best_char = i

print(best_char, characters[best_char])
```

**Output** :

```
s 8
```

-----


**A14**. Do the same as above but now find the least frequent letter. Create the dictionary `characters` that shows each character from string `sally` and its frequency. Then, find the least frequent letter in the string and assign the letter to the variable `worst_char`.


```python
# Given
sally = "sally sells sea shells by the sea shore"


# Solution
sally = "sally sells sea shells by the sea shore"
characters = {}
worst_char = None

for c in sally:
	if c not in characters:
		characters[c] = 0
	characters[c] += 1

for i in list(characters.keys()):
	if worst_char == None:
		worst_char = i
	else:
		if characters[i] <= characters[worst_char]:
			worst_char = i

print("The least frequent letter is", worst_char, "and it appears", characters[worst_char], "times")
```

**Output** :

```
The least frequent letter is r and it appears 1 times
```

-----

**A15**. Create a dictionary named `letter_counts` that contains each letter and the number of times it occurs in `string1`. Challenge: Letters should not be counted separately as upper-case and lower-case. Intead, all of them should be counted as lower-case.


```python
# Given
string1 = "There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures."



# Solution
string1 = "There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures."
letter_counts = {}

for c in string1.lower():
	if c not in letter_counts:
		letter_counts[c] = 0
	letter_counts[c] += 1

print(letter_counts)
```

**Output** :

```
{'t': 19, 'h': 11, 'e': 29, 'r': 12, ' ': 53, 'i': 14, 's': 15, 'a': 17, 'd': 7, 'n': 15, 'f': 9, 'o': 17, 'm': 4, ',': 4, 'w': 6, 'c': 3, 'k': 2, 'l': 11, 'u': 8, '.': 4, 'v': 3, 'y': 1, 'g': 1, 'b': 1}
```

-----


**A16**. Create a dictionary called `low_d` that keeps track of all the characters in the string `p` and notes how many times each character was seen. Make sure that there are no repeats of characters as keys, such that “T” and “t” are both seen as a “t” for example.


```python
# Given
p = "Summer is a great time to go outside. You have to be careful of the sun though because of the heat."




# Solution
p = "Summer is a great time to go outside. You have to be careful of the sun though because of the heat."
low_d = {}

for c in p.lower():
	if c not in low_d:
		low_d[c] = 0
	low_d[c] += 1

print(low_d)
```

**Output** :

```
{'s': 5, 'u': 7, 'm': 3, 'e': 12, 'r': 3, ' ': 20, 'i': 3, 'a': 6, 'g': 3, 't': 9, 'o': 8, 'd': 1, '.': 2, 'y': 1, 'h': 6, 'v': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 2, 'f': 3, 'l': 1, 'n': 1}
```

#### Exercises


**Q1**. Predict what will print out from the following code. If a line causes a run-time error, comment it out and see whether the rest of your predictions were correct.


```python
d = {'apples': 15, 'grapes': 12, 'bananas': 35}
# print(d['banana'])
d['oranges'] = 20
print(len(d))
print('grapes' in d)
# print(d['pears'])
print(d.get('pears', 0))
fruits = d.keys()
print(fruits)
del d['apples']
print('apples' in d)
```

**Output** :

```

```python
pirish = {
			"sir": "matey",
			"hotel": "fleabag inn",
			"student": "swabbie",
			"boy": "matey",
			"madam": "proud beauty",
			"professor": "foul blaggart",

translated = []

for word in sentence:
	if word in pirish:
		word = pirish[word]
	translated.append(word)

pirate_sentence = " ".join(translated)
print(pirate_sentence)
```

**Output** :

```python
# Given
f = open('scarlet.txt', 'r')


# Solution
f = open('scarlet.txt', 'r')
text = f.read()
word_list = text.split()
words = {}
seven_letters = []
most_used = None

for word in word_list:
	if word not in words:
		words[word] = 0
	words[word] += 1

for wrd in words:
	if len(wrd) >= 7:
		seven_letters.append(wrd)

for wd in seven_letters:
	if most_used == None:
		most_used = wd
	else :
		if words[wd] > words[most_used]:
