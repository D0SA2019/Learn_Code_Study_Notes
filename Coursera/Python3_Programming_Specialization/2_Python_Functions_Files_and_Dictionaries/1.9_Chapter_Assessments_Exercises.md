### 1.9. Chapter Assessments & Exercises

#### Assessments

**A1**. The textfile, `travel_plans.txt`, contains the summer travel plans for someone with some commentary. Find the total number of characters in the file and save to the variable `num`.


```python
tr_file = open("travel_plans.txt", "r").read()
num = 0

for char in tr_file:
    num += 1

print(num)
```

**Output** :

```
315
```

-----

**A2**. We have provided a file called `emotion_words.txt` that contains lines of words that describe emotions. Find the total number of words in the file and assign this value to the variable `num_words`.


```python
emo_file = open("emotion_words.txt", "r").read()
num_words = len(emo_file.split())
print(num_words)
```

**Output** :

```
48
```

-----

**A3**. Assign to the variable `num_lines` the number of lines in the file `school_prompt.txt`.


```python
sc_file = open("school_prompt.txt", "r").readlines()
num_lines = 0

for line in sc_file:
    num_lines += 1

print(num_lines)
```

**Output** :

```
10
```

-----


**A4**. Assign the first 30 characters of `school_prompt.txt` as a string to the variable `beginning_chars`.


```python
beginning_chars = open("school_prompt.txt", "r").read(30)
print(beginning_chars)
```

**Output** :

```
30
```

-----

**A5**. Challenge: Using the file `school_prompt.txt`, assign the third word of every line to a list called `three`.


```python
sch_file = open("school_prompt.txt", "r").readlines()
three = []

for line in sch_file:
    line = line.strip().split()
    three.append(line[2])

print(three)
```

**Output** :

```
['for', 'find', 'to', 'many', 'they', 'solid', 'for', 'have', 'some', 'ups,']
```

-----

**A6**. Challenge: Create a list called `emotions` that contains the first word of every line in `emotion_words.txt`.


```python
emo_file = open("emotion_words.txt", "r").readlines()
emotions = []

for line in emo_file:
    line = line.strip().split()
    emotions.append(line[0])

print(emotions)
```

**Output** :

```
['Sad', 'Angry', 'Happy', 'Confused', 'Excited', 'Scared', 'Nervous']
```

-----

-----

**A7**. Assign the first 33 characters from the textfile, `travel_plans.txt` to the variable `first_chars`.


```python
first_chars = open("travel_plans.txt", "r").read(33)
print(first_chars)
```

**Output** :

```
This summer I will be travelling.
```

-----

**A8**. Challenge: Using the file `school_prompt.txt`, if the character ‘p’ is in a word, then add the word to a list called `p_words`.


```python
sc_file = open("school_prompt.txt", "r").read()

words = sc_file.split()
p_words = []

for word in words:
    if "p" in word:
        p_words.append(word)
print(p_words)
```

**Output** :

```
['topic', 'point', 'papers,', 'ups,', 'scripts.']
```

#### Exercises

**Q1**. The following sample file called `studentdata.txt` contains one line for each student in an imaginary class. The students name is the first thing on each line, followed by some exam scores. The number of scores might be different for each student.

```
joe 10 15 20 30 40
bill 23 16 19 22
sue 8 22 17 14 32 17 24 21 2 9 11 17
grace 12 28 21 45 26 10
john 14 32 25 16 89
```

Using the text file `studentdata.txt` write a program that prints out the names of students that have more than six quiz scores.


```python
stu_file = open("studentdata.txt", "r")

for student in stu_file.readlines():
    student = student.strip().split()
    if len(student) > 7:
        print(student[0])
```

**Output** :

```
sue
```

**Q2**. Create a list called `destination` using the data stored in `travel_plans.txt`. Each element of the list should contain a line from the file that lists a country and cities inside that country. Hint: each line that has this information also has a colon `:` in it.


```python
tr_file = open("travel_plans.txt", "r")
destination = []

for line in tr_file.readlines():
    if ":" in line:
        destination.append(line)
print(destination)
tr_file.close()
```

**Output** :

```
['Italy: Rome\n', 'Greece: Athens\n', 'England: London, Manchester\n', 'France: Paris, Nice, Lyon\n', 'Spain: Madrid, Barcelona, Granada\n', 'Austria: Vienna\n']
```

----

**Q3**. Create a list called `j_emotions` that contains every word in `emotion_words.txt` that begins with the letter `“j”`.


```python
emo_file = open("emotion_words.txt", "r")
emo_content = emo_file.read().split()
j_emotions = []

for emo in emo_content:
    if emo[0] == "j":
        j_emotions.append(emo)

print(j_emotions)
```

**Output** :

```
['joyous', 'jittery', 'jumpy']
```
