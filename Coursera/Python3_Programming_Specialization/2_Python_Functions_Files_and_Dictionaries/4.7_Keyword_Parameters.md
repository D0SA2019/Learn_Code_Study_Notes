## Week 4 : More Iteration and Advanced Functions
### 4.7. Keyword Parameters

In the previous section, on Optional Parameters you learned how to define default values for formal parameters, which made it optional to provide values for those parameters when invoking the functions.

In this chapter, you’ll see one more way to invoke functions with optional parameters, with keyword-based parameter passing. This is particularly convenient when there are several optional parameters and you want to provide a value for one of the later parameters while not providing a value for the earlier ones.

The online official python documentation includes a tutorial on optional parameters which covers the topic quite well. Please read the content there: [Keyword arguments](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments)

Don’t worry about the `def cheeseshop(kind, *arguments, **keywords):` example. You should be able to get by without understanding `*parameters` and `**parameters` in this course. But do make sure you understand the stuff above that.

The basic idea of passing arguments by keyword is very simple. When invoking a function, inside the parentheses there are always 0 or more values, separated by commas. With keyword arguments, some of the values can be of the form `paramname = <expr>` instead of just `<expr>`. Note that when you have `paramname = <expr>` in a function definition, it is defining the default value for a parameter when no value is provided in the invocation; when you have `paramname = <expr>` in the invocation, it is supplying a value, overriding the default for that paramname.

```python
def parrot(voltage, state="a stiff", action="voom", type="Norwegian Blue"):
	print("-- This parrot wouldn't " + action,)
	print("if you put " + str(voltage) + " volts through it.")
	print("-- Lovely plumage, the " + type)
	print("-- It's " + state + "!")
	print("")

parrot(1000)																					# 1 positional argument
parrot(voltage=1000)																	# 1 keyword argument
parrot(voltage=1000000, action="VOOOOOM")							# 2 keyword arguments
parrot(action="VOOOOOM", voltage=1000000)							# 2 keyword arguments
parrot("a million", "bereft of life", "jump")					# 3 positional arguments
parrot("a thousand", state="pushing up the daisies")	# 1 positional, 1 keyword arguments
```

**Output**:

```
-- This parrot wouldn't voom
if you put 1000 volts through it.
-- Lovely plumage, the Norwegian Blue
-- It's a stiff!

-- This parrot wouldn't voom
if you put 1000 volts through it.
-- Lovely plumage, the Norwegian Blue
-- It's a stiff!

-- This parrot wouldn't VOOOOOM
if you put 1000000 volts through it.
-- Lovely plumage, the Norwegian Blue
-- It's a stiff!

-- This parrot wouldn't VOOOOOM
if you put 1000000 volts through it.
-- Lovely plumage, the Norwegian Blue
-- It's a stiff!

-- This parrot wouldn't jump
if you put a million volts through it.
-- Lovely plumage, the Norwegian Blue
-- It's bereft of life!

-- This parrot wouldn't voom
if you put a thousand volts through it.
-- Lovely plumage, the Norwegian Blue
-- It's pushing up the daisies!
```

**Note** : Note that we have yet another, slightly different use of the = sign here. As a stand-alone, top-level statement, `x=3`, the variable x is set to 3. Inside the parentheses that invoke a function, `x=3` says that 3 should be bound to the local variable x in the stack frame for the function invocation. Inside the parentheses of a function definition, `x=3` says that 3 should be the value for x in every invocation of the function where no value is explicitly provided for x.


#### Keyword Parameters with `.format`
Earlier you learned how to use the `format` method for strings, which allows you to structure strings like fill-in-the-blank sentences. Now that you’ve learned about optional and keyword parameters, we can introduce a new way to use the `format` method.

This other option is to specifically refer to keywords for interpolation values, like below.

```python
names_scores = [("Jack", [67, 89, 91]), ("Emily", [72, 95, 42]), ("Taylor", [83, 92, 86])]
for name, scores in names_scores:
	print("The scores {nm} gor were: {s1}, {s2}, {s3}".format(nm=name, s1=scores[0], s2=scores[1], s3=scores[2]))
```

**Output**:

```
The scores Jack gor were: 67, 89, 91
The scores Emily gor were: 72, 95, 42
The scores Taylor gor were: 83, 92, 86
```

Sometimes, you may want to use the `.format` method to insert the same value into a string multiple times. You can do this by simply passing the same string into the format method, assuming you have included `{}` s in the string everywhere you want to interpolate them. But you can also use positional passing references to do this! The order in which you pass arguments into the `format` method matters: the first one is argument `0`, the second is argument `1`, and so on.

For example,

```python
# this works
names = ["Jack","Jill","Mary"]
for n in names:
    print("'{}!' she yelled. '{}! {}, {}!'".format(n,n,n,"say hello"))

print("")

# but this also works!
names = ["Jack","Jill","Mary"]
for n in names:
    print("'{0}!' she yelled. '{0}! {0}, {1}!'".format(n,"say hello"))
```

**Output**:

```
'Jack!' she yelled. 'Jack! Jack, say hello!'
'Jill!' she yelled. 'Jill! Jill, say hello!'
'Mary!' she yelled. 'Mary! Mary, say hello!'

'Jack!' she yelled. 'Jack! Jack, say hello!'
'Jill!' she yelled. 'Jill! Jill, say hello!'
'Mary!' she yelled. 'Mary! Mary, say hello!'
```

**Check Your Understanding**

**Q1** : What value will be printed for z?

```python
initial = 7
def f(x, y=3, z=initial):
	print("x, y, z are:", x, y, z)

f(2,5)
```

A. 2 <br>
B. 3 <br>
C. 5 <br>
D. 7 ✅  <br>
E. Runtime error since not enough values are passed in the call to f <br>


-----

**Q2** : What value will be printed for y?

```python
initial = 7
def f(x, y = 3, z = initial):
    print("x, y, z are:", x, y, z)

initial = 0
f(2)
```

```python
names = ["Alexey", "Catalina", "Mitsuki", "Pablo"]
print("'{first}!' she yelled. 'Come here, {first}! {f_one}, {f_two}, and {f_three} are here!'".format(first = names[1], f_one = names[0], f_two = names[2], f_three = names[3]))
```

A. 'first!' she yelled. 'Come here, first! f_one, f_two, and f_three are here!' <br>
B. 'Alexey!' she yelled. 'Come here, Alexey! Catalina, Misuki, and Pablo are here!' <br>
C. 'Catalina!' she yelled. 'Come here, Catalina! Alexey, Misuki, and Pablo are here!' ✅ <br>
D. There is an error. You cannot repeatedly use the keyword parameters. <br>

**Q6** : Define a function called `multiply`. It should have one required parameter, a string. It should also have one optional parameter, an integer, named `mult_int`, with a default value of 10. The function should return the string multiplied by the integer. (i.e.: Given inputs “Hello”, mult_int=3, the function should return “HelloHelloHello”)

```python
def multiply(str, mult_int=10):
    return str * mult_int

print(multiply("hello "))
print(multiply("ha"))
print(multiply("Hello ", 3))
```

**Output** :

```
hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello
hahahahahahahahahaha
Hello Hello Hello
```

-----

**Q7** : Currently the function is supposed to take 1 required parameter, and 2 optional parameters, however the code doesn’t work. Fix the code so that it passes the test. This should only require changing one line of code.

```python
# Given
def waste(var = "Water", mar, marble = "type"):
    final_string = var + " " + marble + " " + mar
    return final_string



# Solution
def waste(mar, var = "Water", marble = "type"):
    final_string = var + " " + marble + " " + mar
    return final_string

print(waste("Pokemon"))
```

**Output** :

```
Water type Pokemon
```
