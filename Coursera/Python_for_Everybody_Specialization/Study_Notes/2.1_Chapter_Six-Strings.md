# 2.1 Chapter Six: Strings
## String Data Type
A string is a sequence of characters and literal uses quotes "Hello" or 'Hello'. For strings, + means concatenate. When a string contains numbers, it is still a string but we can convert numbers in a string into a number using `int()`.

```python
# string example 1
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = 'there'
bob = str1 + str2
print(bob)									# Output : Hellothere

# string example 2
str3 = '123'
str3 = str1 + 1
# Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 9, in <module>
# TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects

# string example 3
x = int(str3) + 1
print(x)									# Output : 124
```

## Reading and Converting
We prefer to read data in using strings and then parse and convert the data as we need. This gives us more control over error situations and/or bad user input.

You can see below why the input numbers must be converted from strings.

```python
name = input("Enter:")					# User Input : Chuck
print(name)											# Output : Chuck

apple = input("Enter:")
x = apple - 10
# Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 5, in <module>
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for - :'str' and 'int'

x = int(apple) - 10
print(x)
```

## Looking Inside Strings
The expression in brackets is called an **index**. The index indicates which character in the sequence you want (hence the name). You can use any expression, including variables and operators, as an index, but the value of the index has to be an integer.

We can get at any single character in a string using an index specified in square brackets.

The index value must be integer and starts at zero and it can be an expression that is computed.

```python
fruit = "banana"
letter = fruit[1]
print(letter)								# Output : a

x = 3
w = fruit[x - 1]
print(w)										# Output : n
```  

You will get a python error if you attempt to index beyond the end of a string. So be careful when constructing index values and slices.

In the example below, we wanted to print the 5th character of zot, but we received an error because `zot` is a 3-character string. If the given string is not as long as the number of characters we want, Python will give an error.

```python
zot = "abc"
print(zot[5])
# Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
# IndexError: string index out of range
```

### `len()` Function
`len()` is a built-in function that returns the number of characters in a string.

A function is some stored code that we use. A function takes some input and produces an output.

```python
fruit = "banana"
x = len(fruit)
print(x)							# Output : 6
```

## Looping Through Strings
A lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a time. Often they start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the end. This pattern of processing is called a **traversal**. One way to write a traversal is with a while loop

Using a **while** statement and a iteration variable, and the **len** function, we can construct a loop to look at each of the letters in a string individually.


```python
fruit = "banana"
index = 0
while index < len(fruit):
	letter = fruit[index]
	print(index, letter)
	index = index + 1

# Output
0 b
1 a
2 n
3 a
4 n
5 a
```

We can do the same thing with **for** statement. A definite loop using a for statement is much more elegant. The iteration variable is completely taken care of by the for loop.

```python
fruit = "banana"
for letter in fruit:
	print(letter)

	# Output :
b
a
n
a
n
a
```


## Looping and Counting
This is a simple loop that loops through each letter in a string and counts the number of times the loop encounters the "a" character


```python
word = "banana"
count = 0
for letter in word:
	if letter == "a":
		count = count + 1
print(count)								# Output : 3
```


#### Looking Deeper into "in"
The word **in** is a boolean operator that takes two strings and returns True if the first appears as a substring in the second.

The iteration variable "iterates" through the sequence (ordered set).

The block (body) of code is executed once for each value in the sequence.

The iteration variable moves through all of the values in the sequence.

## Slicing Strings

A segment of a string is called a slice. Selecting a slice is similar to selecting a character.  We can also look at any continues section of a string using a colon operator.

The second number is one beyond the end of the slice - "up to but not including". If the second number is beyond the end of the string, it stops at the end.

As in the example below, we can extract data between the characters specified in a string. However, what should be considered here is that when you take the 0: 4 character, it actually takes 0,1,2,3 characters and does not get 4.

<img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/2ev3onl.png" width="300" align="center">

```python
s = "Monty Python"
print(s[0:4])				# Output : Mont
print(s[6:7])				# Output : P
print(s[6:20])			# Output : Python
```

If we leave off the first number or last number of the slice, it is assumed to be the beginning or end of the string respectively. Also we can use slicing like this :

```Python
s = "Monty Python"
print(s[:2])			# Output : Mo
print(s[8:])			# Output : thon
print(s[:])				# Output : Monty Python
```


## String Concatenation
When the **+** operator is applied to strings, it means "concatenation".
If we want to see the two strings together, we need to show the spaces specifically to Python. Otherwise, they are read, detected and written adjacent to the program.

```python
a = "Hello"
b = a + "There"
print(b)							# Output : HelloThere

c = a + " " + "There"
print(c)							# Output : Hello There
```

## Using "in" as a Logical Operator
The **in** keyword can also be used to check to see if one strings is "in" another string.

The **in** expression is a logical expression that returns True or False and can be used in an **if** statement.

```
fruit = "banana"
>>>"n" in fruit
True
>>>"m" in fruit
False
>>>"nan" in fruit
True
>>>if "a" in fruit:
	print("Found it!")
Found it!
```

## String comparison
The comparison operators work on strings. but this comparison is slightly different from the real world. Alphabetic order of letters is important in the comparison between words. Capital letters are always lower than lowercase letters. The following examples show how this comparison works.

A < a

z < a

Chuck < Glenn

Glenn < chuck  

```Python
if word == "banana":
	print("All right, bananas.")

if word < "banana":
	print("Your word, " + word + ", comes before banana.")
elif word > "banana":
	print("Your word, " + word + ", comes after banana.")
else:
	print("All right, bananas.")
```

## String library
Strings are an example of Python objects. An object contains both data (the actual string itself) and methods, which are effectively functions that are built into the object and are available to any instance of the object.

Python has a number of string functions which are in the string library.
These functions are already built into every string - we invoke them by appending the function to the string variable.

These functions do not modify the original string, instead they return a new string that has been altered.

```Python
zap = greet.lower()
print(zap)                      # Output : hello bob
print(greet)                    # Output : Hello Bob
print("Hi there".lower())       # Output : hi there
```

Python has a function called **dir** which lists the methods available for an object. The type function shows the type of an object and the dir function shows the available methods.

```python
stuff = "Hello word"
type(stuff)               # Output : <class "str">

dir(stuff)
["capitalize", "casefold", "center", "count", "encode", "endswith", "expandtabs", "find", "format", "format_map", "index", "isalnum", "isalpha", "isdecimal", "isdigit", "isedentifier", "islower", "isnumeric", "isprintable", "isspace", "istitle", "isupper", "join", "ljust", "lower", "lstrip", "maketrans", "partition", "replace", "rfind", "rindex", "rjust", "rpartition", "rsplit", "rstrip", "split", "splitlines", "startswith", "strip", "swapcase", "title", "translate", "upper", "zfill"]
```


Some of more common things that we do in string library.

```python
str.capitalize()
str.center(width[, fillchar])
str.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])
str.find(sub[, start[, end]])
str.lstrip([chars])
str.replace(old, new[, count])
str.lower()
str.rstrip([chars])
str.strip([chars])
str.upper()
```

#### `str.capitalize()`
This method makes the given letter capitalize.

```Python
str5 = "heval"
str6 = "HEVAL"
print(str5.capitalize())				# Output : Heval
print(str6.capitalize())				# Outpu : Heval
```

#### `str.find()` : Searching a string
We use the `.find()` function to search for a substring within another string

`.find()` finds the first occurrence of the substring

If the substring is not found, `.find()` returns **-1**

Remember that string position starts at zero

Among these methods, one of the most frequently used methods is `.find`. it works with logic, but instead of True / False in `in` allows us to write more effective commands. In this method, if no result is obtained, the result is -1.

The number 2 in the example below tells us that the beginning of "na" letters are in the 2nd step.

<img src="http://i63.tinypic.com/20r9q2q.png" width="150" align="center">

```Python
fruit = "banana"
pos = fruit.find("na")
print(pos)								# Output : 2

aa = fruit.find("z")
print(aa)									# Output : -1
```

#### `str.upper()` / `str.lower()`
You can make a copy of a string in lower case or upper case. Often when we are searching for a string using `find()`we first convert the string to lower case so we can search a string regardless of case.

```python
greet = "Hello Bob"
nn = greet.upper()
print(nnn)                  # Output : HELLO BOB

www = greet.lower()
print(www)                  # Output : hello bob
```

#### `str.replace()` : Search and Replace
The `replace()` function is like a "search and replace" operation in a word processor. It replace all occurrences of the search string with the replacement string.

```python
greet = "Hello Bob"
nstr = greet.replace("Bob", "Jane")
print(nstr)														# Output : Hello Jane

nstr = greet.replace("o", "X")
print(nstr)														# Output : HellX BXb
```

#### `str.strip()` / `str.lstrip()` / `str.rstrip()` : Stripping whitespace

Sometimes we want to take a string and remove whitespace at the beginning and/or end. The strip method is used to delete whitespace, ie spaces in a string.

`lstrip()` and `rstrip()` remove whitespace at he left or right

`strip()` removes both beginning and ending whitespace


```python
greet = "    Hello Bob    "
print(greet.lstrip())              # Output : "Hello Bob   "
print(greet.rstrip())              # Output : "   Hello Bob"
print(greet.strip())               # Output : "Hello Bob"
```


#### `str.startswith()` : Prefixes
Queries and verifies which word string starts with.

```python
line = "Please have a nice day"
print(line.startswith("Please"))        # Output : True
print(line.startswith("p"))             # Output : False
```

## Parsing and Extracting
In the following example, the logical method of ".find" is used. In a post, the extension at the email was requested. To do this, first find the "@" sign and find out which digit it is in, then search for the space next to the "@" sign and set the digit. Thus, the remaining part between these two digits when pulling the email address extension learned.

```python
data = "From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008"
atpos = data.find("@")
print(atpos)            # Output : 21

sppos = data.find(" ", atpos)
print(sppos)            # Output : 31

host = data[atpos + 1 : sppos]
print(host)             # Output : uct.ac.za
```
