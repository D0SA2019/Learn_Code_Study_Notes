# 1.5. Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration

# Infinite loops
## while

Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly. Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it easier.

Loops (repeated steps) have iteration variables that change each time through a loop. Often these iteration variables go through a sequence of numbers.

One form of iteration in Python is the while statement. Here is a simple program that counts down from five and then says "Blastoff!". You can almost read the while statement as if it were English. It means, "While n is greater than 0, display the value of n and then reduce the value of n by 1. When you get to 0, exit the while statement and display the word Blastoff!"

```python
n = 5
while n > 0 :
  print(n)                
  n = n - 1
print("Blastoff!")
print(n)
# Output :
# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1
# Blastoff!
# 0
```

This type of flow is called a loop because the third step loops back around to the top. We call each time we execute the body of the loop an iteration. For the above loop, we would say, "It had five iterations", which means that the body of the loop was executed five times.

The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates. We call the variable that changes each time the loop executes and controls when the loop finishes the iteration variable. If there is no iteration variable, the loop will repeat forever, resulting in an infinite loop. You can see the infinite loop example below.

```python
# An infinite loop
n = 5
while n > 0 :
  print("Lather")
  print("Rinse")
print("Dry off!")
```

## break

Sometimes you don't know it's time to end a loop until you get half way through the body. In that case you can write an infinite loop on purpose and then use the break statement to jump out of the loop. The **break** statement ends the current loop and jumps to the statement immediately following the loop. It is like a loop test that can happen anywhere in the body of the loop.

In the following example, the program prompts the user to enter a data and continues the loop until the data is entered as "done". When the user receives a "done" entry, the loop is ended and the next step is taken.

```python
# Breaking out of a loop
while True :
  line = input("> ")
  if line == "done" :
    break
  print(line)
print("Done!")
```

The above code sequence is run as follows. Sorts that are ">" at the beginning are the places that the user enters.

```
> hello there
hello there
> finished
finished
> done
Done!
```
Below you see the logical schema of this code.

## continue
Sometimes you are in an iteration of a loop and want to finish the current iteration and immediately jump to the next iteration. In that case you can use the continue statement to skip to the next iteration without finishing the body of the loop for the current iteration. The **continue** statement ends the current iteration and jumps to the top of the loop and starts the next iteration.

In the example below, if the data entered by the user is `#` or `done`, the loop continues by typing the entered data and returning to the beginning. The loop ends when typed `done`. When typed "#", it normally wraps the loop instead of the `print (line)` command. The other lines in the loop are bypassed and return to the beginning of the cycle.

```python
# Finishing an iteration with continue
while True :
  line = input("> ")
  if line[0] == "#" :
    continue
  if line == "done" :
    break
  print(line)
print("Done!")
```

The above code sequence is run as follows. Sorts that are ">" at the beginning are the places that the user enters.

```
> hello there
hello there
> # dont print this
> print this
print this
> done
Done!
```

# Definite loops
## for

Sometimes we want to loop through a set of things such as a list of words, the lines in a file, or a list of numbers. When we have a list of things to loop through, we can construct a definite loop using a for statement.  We call the while statement an indefinite loop because it simply loops until some condition becomes False, whereas the for loop is looping through a known set of items so it runs through as many iterations as there are items in the set.

The **for** command is used to loop through limited data. For example, numbers between 10 and 20 or 240 rows in the excel table. In the example below, `i` is actually a variable, so the name can be changed with the desired thing.

```python
# A simple definite loop
for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] :
  print(i)
print("Blastoff!")
# Output :
# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1
# Blastoff!
```

The definite loops can be used for strings too.

```python
# A definite loop with strings
friends = ["Joseph", "Glenn", "Sally"]
for friend in friends :
  print("Happy New Year:", friend)
print("Done!")
# Output
# Happy New Year: Joseph
# Happy New Year: Glenn
# Happy New Year: Sally
# Done!
```

## in
The iteration variable iterates through the sequence (ordered set). The block (body) of code is executed once for each value in the sequence. The iteration variable moves through all of the values in the sequence.

```python
for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] :
  print(i)
```

**Making smart loops**
The trick is "knowing" something about the whole loop when you are stuck writing code that only sees one entry at a time

```python
# Looping through a set
print("Before")
for thing in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
  print(thing)
print("After")
# Output :
# Before
# 9
# 41
# 12
# 3
# 74
# 15
# After
```

## Finding the Largest Value
We make a variable that contains the largest value we have seen so far. If the current number we are looking at is larger, it is the new largest value we have seen so far.

```python
# Finding the largest value
largest_so_far = -1
print("Before", largest_so_far)
for the_num in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
  if the_num > [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
    largest_so_far = the_num
  print(largest_so_far, the_num)
print("After", largest_so_far)
# Output
# Before -1
# 9 9
# 41 41
# 41 12
# 41 3
# 74 74
# 74 15
# After 74
```

## Counting in a loop
To count how many times we execute a loop, we introduce a counter variable that starts at 0 and we add one to it each time through the loop.  

```python
# Counting in a loop
zork = 0
print("Before", zork)
for thing in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
  zork = zork + 1
  print(zork, thing)
print("After", zork)
# Output
# Before 0
# 1 9
# 2 41
# 3 12
# 4 3
# 5 74
# 6 15
# After 6
```

## Summing in a loop
To add up a value we encounter in a loop, we introduce a sum variable that starts at 0 and we add the value to the sum each time through the loop.

```python
# Summing in a loop
zork = 0
print("Before", zork)
for thing in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
  zork = zork + thing
  print(zork, thing)
print("After", zork)
# Output
# 9 9
# 50 41
# 62 12
# 65 3
# 139 74
# 154 15
# After 154
```

## Finding the average in a loop
An average just combines the counting the counting and sum patterns and divides when the loop is done.


```python
count = 0
sum = 0
print("Before", count, sum)
for value in [9, 41, 12 3, 74, 15] :
  count = count + 1
  sum = sum + value
  print(count, sum, value)
print("After", count, sum, sum / count)
# Output
# Before 0 0
# 1 9 9
# 2 50 41
# 3 62 12
# 4 65 3
# 5 139 74
# 6 154 25
# After 6 154 25
```

## Filtering in a Loop
We use an if statement in the loop to catch / filter the values we are looking for.

```python
print("Before")
for value in [9, 41, 12 3, 74, 15] :
  if value > 20 :
    print("Large number", value)
print("After")
# Output
# Before
# Large number 41
# Large number 74
# After
```

## Search Using a Boolean Variable

If we just want to search and know if a value was found, we use a variable that starts at False and is set to True as soon as we find what we are looking for.

```python
found = False
print("Before", found)
for value in [9, 41, 12 3, 74, 15] :
  if value == 3 :
    found = True
  print(found, value)
print("After", found)
# Output
# Before False
# False 9
# False 41
# False 12
# True 3
# True 74
# True 15
# After True
```

## Finding the Smallest Value
We switched the variable name to smallest_so_far and switch the > to <

```python
smallest_so_far = -1
print("Before", smallest_so_for)
for the_num in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
  if the_num < smallest_so_far :
    smallest_so_far = the_num
  print(smallest_so_far, the_num)
print("After", smallest_so_far)
# Output
# Before -1
# -1 9
# -1 9
# -1 12
# -1 3
# -1 74
# -1 15
# After -1
```

## Finding the Smallest Value
We still have a variable that is the smallest so far. The first time through the loop smallest is None, so we take the first value to be the smallest.

```python
smallest = None
print("Before")
for value in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
  if smallest is None :
    smallest = value
  elif value < smallest :
    smallest = value
  print(smallest, value)
print("After", smallest)
# Output
# Before
# 9 9
# 9 41
# 9 12
# 3 3
# 3 74
# 3 15
# After 3
```

## The "is" and "is not" Operators
Python has an is operator that can be used in logical expressions

Implies "is the same as"

Similar to, but stronger than ==

is not also is a logical operator

```python
smallest = None
print("Before")
for value in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15] :
  if smallest is None :
    smallest = value
  elif value < smallest :
    smallest = value
  print(smallest, value)
print("After", smallest)
```
