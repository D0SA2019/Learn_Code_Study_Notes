# Assignment 12.1 : Understanding the Request / Response Cycle
### Exploring the HyperText Transport Protocol

You are to retrieve the following document using the HTTP protocol in a way that you can examine the HTTP Response headers.

http://data.pr4e.org/intro-short.txt

There are three ways that you might retrieve this web page and look at the response headers:

* Preferred: Modify the socket1.py program to retrieve the above URL and print out the headers and data. Make sure to change the code to retrieve the above URL - the values are different for each URL.

* Open the URL in a web browser with a developer console or FireBug and manually examine the headers that are returned.

* Use the telnet program as shown in lecture to retrieve the headers and content.

```python
# GIVEN CODE : socket.py
import socket

mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))
cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd)

while True:
    data = mysock.recv(512)
    if len(data) < 1:
        break
    print(data.decode(),end='')

mysock.close()

# SOLUTION
import socket

mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))
cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/intro-short.txt HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd)

while True:
    data = mysock.recv(512)
    if len(data) < 1:
        break
    print(data.decode(),end='')

mysock.close()
```

#### Output :

Why should you learn to write programs?

Writing programs (or programming) is a very creative
and rewarding activity.  You can write programs for
many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving
a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping
someone else solve a problem.  This book assumes that
everyone needs to know how to program, and that once
you know how to program you will figure out what you want
to do with your newfound skills.
