# 1.1 Chapter One - Why We Program?
*Course 01 : Getting Started With Python*

## About Python
Python was developed by a Dutch programmer named Guido Van Rossum in the early 90s. Most people think that this programming language is taken from the python snake by being called Python. However, the name of this programming language does not come from the snake. Guido Van Rossum named this programming language inspired by a show by Monty Python koms Flying Circus, a British comedy group called The Monty Python.

## Computer hardware architecture

This is how computers are built. If you were to take apart your computer or cell phone and look deep inside, you would find the following parts:

![arch.svg](https://www.py4e.com/images/arch.svg)


**Central Processing Unit (or CPU)** : The part that runs the program and asks always "What's next?". It's dump but fast. If your computer is rated at 3.0 Gigahertz, it means that the CPU will ask "What next?" three billion times per second.

**Main Memory** : The part that stores the information. It's a fast small temporary storage and it losts the informations on reboot. (aka RAM)

**Secondary Memory** : The part that stores the information permanent. It's slower than main memory. It keeps the informations until delete even when there is no power to the computer. Examples of secondary memory are  disk drives and memory sticks.

**Input and Output Devices** : The parts that the ways we interact with the computer. Examples of input devices are keyboard, mouse, touch screen, and output devices are screen, speakers, printer, DVD burner.

**Network Connection** : The parts that retrieves information over a network. We can think the network is a slower and at times unreliable form of Secondary Memory. 

As a programmer you are the person who answers the CPU's "What next?" question by some instructions called the program. Sometimes you will tell the CPU to use the main memory, secondary memory, network, or the input/output devices.

## Conversing with Python
#### Differences between Python2 and Python3
First a little note about Python versions. Python3 is much more powerful than Python2, and is free of Python2's errors. A program that you write using Python3 does not work under Python2. The same applies to the opposite. So you must be careful what version that you use. 

Statements|Pyhton 2|Pyhton 3|
|:---:|---|---|
print|print "hello world"|print("hello world")
input|raw_input('What is your name?')|input('What is your name?')

<br>


#### Running Python3 on Terminal 
When you write `python3` on your terminal you can see the Python version on your computer. This is the way of Python says "I'm here, what's next?". 


```python 
Heval:~ hevalhazalkurt$ python3
Python 3.6.5 (default, Apr 25 2018, 14:26:36)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```

<br>

#### Basic definitions

When we say to Python `x = 1` it means *"when you see x, replace with it 1"*. 

In a script like below, we say Python in `x = 1` before we say print, and then we say `x = x + 1`, so the program will take 1 instead of x instead of the previous command and print it. The result is as follows.

```python
# Understanding Python with a little test on Terminal
>>> x = 1
>>> print (x)
1
>>> x = x + 1
>>> print(x)
2
>>> exit()
Heval:~ hevalhazalkurt$ 
```

The `>>>` prompt is the Python interpreter's way of asking you, "What do you want me to do next?" Python is ready to have a conversation with you.

<br>

#### Speaking same language 
Seeing syntax error in Python indicates that you did not speak the same language and didn't understand you.

```python
# Talking with Python in wrong language
>>> I come in peace, please take me to your leader
File "<stdin>", line 1
  I come in peace, please take me to your leader
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>>

# Talking with Python in right language
>>> print("You must be the legendary god that comes from the sky")
You must be the legendary god that comes from the sky
>>> print("We have been waiting for you for a long time")
We have been waiting for you for a long time
>>> print("Our legend says you will be very tasty with mustard")
Our legend says you will be very tasty with mustard
>>> print("We will have a feast tonight unless you say")
>>> We will have a feast tonight unless you say
```

## Elements of Python 

**Vocabulary / Words** —> Variables and Reserved Words
**Sentence Structure** —> Valid syntax patterns
**Story Structure** —> Constructing a program for a purpose

#### Reserved Words
Python's "reserved words" means vocabulary of the language. When Python sees these words in a Python program, they have one and only one meaning to Python. You can't change the meaning of these words. They runs one specific thing in Python. 

Python’da reserved words dediği şey program tarafından kullanılan komut kelimeleridir. Diğer her türlü kelime ve kelime bütününü kendimiz atayabilirken bunları değiştiremeyiz. 

```python
# Python Reserved Words
false              class          return          is            finally
none               if             for             lambda        continue
true               def            from            while         nonlocal
and                elif           try             or            yield
assert             else           import          pass          
break              except         in              raise
``` 

<br>

#### Sentences or Lines

As you can see below, `x` is what we have determined as **Variable**, `print` is the **Function** we want to do so, `2` is the **Constant** values we give. While **Variables** values may vary depending on what we want to do in the program, **Constant** does not change.


```python
# Sentences or Lines
x = 2               # --> Assignment statement 
x = x + 2           # --> Assignment with expression 
print(x)            # --> Print function 

# x --> Variable 
# = --> Operator
# 2 --> Constant
# print --> Function
```
<br>

## Programming Paragraphs

#### Python Scripts
Interactive Python is good for experiments and programs of 3-4 lines long. Most programs are much longer, so we type them into a file and tell Python to run the commands in the file. In a sense, we are “giving Python a script”. As a convention, we add “.py” as the suffix on the end of these files to indicate they contain Python.

Type|Description|
|:---:|---|
Interactive|You type directly to Python one line at a time and it responds
Script|You enter a sequence of statements (lines) into a file using a text  editor and tell Python to execute the statements in the file

<br>


#### Program Steps or Program Flow

* Like a recipe or installation instructions, a program is a **sequence** of steps to be done in order.
* Some steps are **conditional** , they may be skipped.
* Sometimes a step or group of steps is to be **repeated**.
* Sometimes we store a set of steps to be used over and over as needed several places throughout the program. 

There are some low-level conceptual patterns that we use to construct programs.

Definition|Description|
|:---:|---|
input|Get data from the "outside world". This might be reading data from a file, or even some kind of sensor like a microphone or GPS. In our initial programs, our input will come from the user typing data on the keyboard.
output|Display the results of the program on a screen or store them in a file or perhaps write them to a device like a speaker to play music or speak text.
sequential execution|Perform statements one after another in the order they are encountered in the script.
conditional execution|Check for certain conditions and then execute or skip a sequence of statements.
repeated execution|Perform some set of statements repeatedly, usually with some variation.
reuse|Write a set of instructions once and give them a name and then reuse those instructions as needed throughout your program.



<br>

#### Sequential Steps

In sequential steps, Python performs and finishes the given commands in the order in which they are written. When a program is running, it flows from one step to the next. As programmers, we set up **paths** for the program to follow. 

```python
# Sequential flow example
x = 2
print(x)          # --> Output : 2
x = x + 2
print(x)          # --> Output : 4
```

Below you see the logical schema of this code.

<br>

#### Conditional Steps

Conditional steps are executed with the **if** command and the next steps and commands are passed according to the correct and incorrect conditions.


```python
# Conditional flow example
x = 5
if x < 10 :
  print("Smaller")      # --> Output : Smaller
if x > 20 :
  print("Bigger")       # --> Output : Bigger
print("Finis")          # --> Output : Finis
```

Below you see the logical schema of this code.

<br>

#### Repeated Steps

Repeated steps are executed with the **while** command and provides a repetition of a certain command process until it meets the required conditions. Loops (repeated steps) have **iteration variables** that change each time through a loop. 

```python
# Repeated flow example
n = 5
while n > 0 : 
  print(n)          # --> Output : 5 4 3 2 1 each line
  n = n - 1         
print("Blastoff!")  # --> Output : Blastoff!
```

Below you see the logical schema of this code.

#### A short Python story about how to count words in a file 
It's a little demonstration how can read a code.

```python
# A word used to read data from a user
name = input("Enter file:")     
handle = open(name, "r")

# A sentence about updating one of the many counts
counts = dict()
for line in handle :
  words = line.split()
  for word in words :
    counts[word] = counts.get(word,0) + 1     

# A paragraph about how to find the largest item in a list
bigcount = None
bigword = None
for word, count in counts.items() :
  if bigcount is None or count > bigcount :
    bigword = word
    bigcount = count

print(bigword, bigcount)
```
