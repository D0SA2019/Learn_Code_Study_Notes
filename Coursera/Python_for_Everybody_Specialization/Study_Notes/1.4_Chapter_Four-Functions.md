# 1.4. Chapter Four: Functions

In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can "call" the function by name.

`type(32)`

The name of the function is type. The expression in parentheses is called the argument of the function. The argument is a value or variable that we are passing into the function as input to the function. The result, for the type function, is the type of the argument.

# Store and Reuse
## def
We don't want to rewrite repeated codes in a program because it means we'll need to change each one individually if we need to make changes later. Instead, we can assign a name to the repeating block and re-run it where necessary. This is called as store and **reuse** and is defined with **def**. We call these reusable pieces of code **functions**.

The code snippet that we define with `def` is actually a function that doesn't work unless you call it. The code snippet that you define is used to store memory in the program, and is run by calling it where appropriate.


```python
# Stored and reused steps
def thing() :
  print("Hello")
  print("Fun")
thing()               # Output : Hello / Fun
print("Zip")          # Output : Zip
thing()               # Output : Hello / Fun
```

Below you see the logical schema of this code.

## max - tiny

The `max` and `min` functions give us the largest and smallest values in a list, respectively. The max function tells us the "largest character" in the string and the min function shows us the smallest character.

A function is some stored code that we use. A function takes some input and produces an output.

```python
big = max("Hello world")
print(big)                  # Output : w

tiny = min("Hello world")
print(tiny)                 # Output :  (space)
```


## Type conversions

Python also provides built-in functions that convert values from one type to another. The int function takes any value and converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise

int can convert floating-point values to integers, but it doesn't round off; it chops off the fraction part.

```python
int(3.9999)               # Output : 3

int(-2.3)                 # Output : -2
```
float converts integers and strings to floating-point numbers.

When you put an integer and floating point in an expression, the integer is implicity converted to a float.

You can control this with build-in functions `int()` and `float()`.

```python
print(float(99) / 100)             # Output : 0.99

i = 42
print(type(i))                     # Output : <class "int">

f = float(i)
print(f)                          # Output : 42.0

print(type(f))                    # Output : <class "float">

print(1 + 2 * float(3) / 4 - 5)   # Output : -2.5
```

str converts its argument to a string.

You can also use `int()` and `float()` to convert between strings and integers.

You will get an error if the string does not contain numeric characters.


```python
sval = "123"
print(type(sval))           # Output : <class "str">
print(sval + 1)
# Output : Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> TypeError: cannot concatenate "str" and "int"

ival = int(sval)
print(type(ival))           # Output : <class "int">
print(ival + 1)             # Output : 124

nsv = "hello bob"
niv = int(nsv)
# Output : Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> ValueError: invalid literal for int()
```

# Building our own functions
A function definition specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called. Once we define a function, we can reuse the function over and over throughout our program. The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the first character can't be a number. You can't use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name.

The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn't take any arguments. The first line of the function definition is called the header; the rest is called the body. The header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, the indentation is always four spaces. The body can contain any number of statements.

`def` is a keyword that indicates that this is a function definition. We create a new function using the **def** keyword followed by optional parameters in parantheses. We indent the body of the function. This defines the function but does not execute the body of the function. Look at the example below.

```python
x = 5
print("Hello")                      # Output : Hello

def print_lyrics() :                # Don't execute because it isn't called later
  print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
  print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")

print("Yo")                         # Output : Yo
x = x + 2
print(x)                            # Output : 7
```

### Parameters and Arguments
Some of the built-in functions we have seen require arguments. For example, when you call *math.sin* you pass a number as an argument. Some functions take more than one argument: *math.pow* takes two, the base and the exponent.

Inside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called parameters.Here is an example of a user-defined function that takes an argument.

```python
def print_twice(bruce):
  print(bruce)
  print(bruce)
```

An argument is a value we pass into the function as its input when we call the function. We use arguments so we can direct the function to the different kinds of work when we call it at different times. We put the arguments in parentheses after the name of the function

```python
big = max("Hello world")    # "Hello world" is an argument
```
A parameter is a variable which we use in the function definition. It is a handle that allows the code in the function to access the arguments for a particular function invocation.

Diversifying the functions, ie, commands with parameters are possible. In the example below, we have a command of our own which we define as `greet`. To diversify this, we want to use the parameter `lang`. `lang` can be anything instead of selecting the name depending on us. With this code snippet, we tell the program to execute different code line for every lang value. Then, when we call the greet again, we can run it according to these parameters. Therefore, instead of writing different commands to create commands that function similarly, we can diversify them with parameters and facilitate work and program flow.

```python
def greet(lang) :
  if lang == "es" :
    print("Hola")
  elif lang == "fr" :
    print("Bonjour")
  else :
    print("Hello")

greet("en")               # Output : Hello
greet("es")               # Output : Hola
greet("fr")               # Output : Bonjour
```

## return
Often a function will take its arguments, do some computation, and return a value to be used as the value of the function call in the calling expression. The return keyword is used for this.

```python
# return values
def greet() :
return "Hello"

print(greet(), "Glenn")   # Output : Hello Glenn
print(greet(), "Sally")   # Output : Hello Sally
```

A "fruitful" function is one that produces a result (or return value).

The return statement ends the function execution and "sends back" the result of the function.


```python
def greet(lang) :
  if lang == "es" :
    print("Hola")
  elif lang == "fr" :
    print("Bonjour")
  else :
    print("Hello")

print(greet("en"), "Glenn")        # Output : Hello Glenn
print(greet("es"), "Sally")        # Output : Hola Sally
print(greet("fr"), "Michael")      # Output : Bonjour
```

## Multiple Parameters / Arguments
We can define more than one parameter in the function definition.

We simply add more arguments when we call the function.

We match the number and order of arguments and parameters.

As in the following example, we define `addtwo` as the sum of the two numbers given, and then the process takes place automatically.

```python
def addtwo(a, b) :
  added = a + b
  return added

x = addtwo(3, 5)
print(x)                # Output : 8
```
