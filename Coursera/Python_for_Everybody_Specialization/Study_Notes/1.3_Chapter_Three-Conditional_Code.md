# 1.3 Chapter Three: Conditional Code

# One-Way Decisions
## if : conditional execution
The boolean expression after the if statement is called the condition. We end the if statement with a colon character ( : ) and the line(s) after the if statement are indented. If the logical condition is true, then the indented statement gets executed. If the logical condition is false, the indented statement is skipped.


```python
# Conditional Steps
x = 5
if x < 10 :
  print("Smaller")          # Output : Smaller
if x > 20 :
  print(Bigger)             # Output : Bigger (when x > 20)
print("Finish")             # Output : Finnish
```

Below you see the logical schema of this code.

In the code group above, a indentation appears in front of the `print` command. Programs such as Atom do this automatically after `if ...:`, but if it is to be used outside of these programs, it is good to know that this space corresponds to 4 space characters. The indents are important in the Python, it does not work correctly when used incorrectly. Also these spaces are called as "whitespace".


#### Comparision Operators

The comparison operators enable two data to be evaluated against each other and to perform an action according to the result obtained. The type of this data can be an integer, string etc.

There are two types of comparison operators. The first of these is Boolean expressions and evaluates the data in terms of being `True` or `False`. The other is mathematical comparisons.

**Boolean expressions** is an expression that is either true or false. `True` and `False` are special values that belong to the class bool; they are not strings.

The most important place to be considered is the `==` part in comparison operators. Because in Python the = sign is actually used to define a variable and assignment. What it describes is integer, like `x = 1`, or a string like` x = apple`. The program uses it to understand what to put in place of x. In mathematical operations, so that a process or value is equal so that it is not contradictory, we question it with `==`.

```python
x = 5
if x == 5 :
  print("Equals 5")                     # Output : Equals 5

if x > 4 :
  print("Greater than 4")               # Output : Greater than 4

if x >= 5 :
  print("Greater than or Equals 5")     # Output : Greater than or Equals 5

if x < 6 : print("Less than 6")         # Output : Less than 6

if x <= 5 :
  print("Less than or Equals 5")        # Output : Less than or Equals 5

if x != 6 :
  print("Not equal 6")                  # Output : Not equal 6
```

As seen in the code snippet below, spaces are important in programming because each indented portion is considered to be linked to the previous section. At the end, the `print (" Afterwards 6 ")` section would not be executed if it was indented. So pay attention to the indentations.

```python
x = 5
print("Before 5")         # Output : Before 5
if x == 5 :
  print("Is 5")           # Output : Is 5
  print("Is Still 5")     # Output : Is Still 5
  print("Third 5")        # Output : Third 5
print("Afterwards 5")     # Output : Afterwards 5
print("Before 6")         # Output : Before 6
if x == 6 :
  print("Is 6")           # Output : Is 6
  print("Is Still 6")     # Output : Is Still 6
  print("Third 6")        # Output : Third 6
print("Afterwards 6")     # Output : Afterwards 6
```

#### Indentation
**Increase indent**  indent after an `if` statement or `for` statement (after : )

**Maintain indent** to indicate the scope of the block (which lines are affected by the if/for)

**Reduce indent** back to the level of the `if` statement or `for` statement to indicate the end of the block

**Blank lines** are ignored - they do not affect indentation

**Comments** on a line by themselves are ignored with regard to indentation

Atom automatically uses space for files wit ".py" extension.

Most text editors can turn tabs into spaces - make sure to enable this feature

Python cares a lot about how far a line is indented. If you mix tabs and spaces you may get indentation errors even if everything looks fine.

It is one of the most important stages of writing code to determine where the blocks begin and end.

```python
# Think about begin / end blocks
x = 5
if x > 2 :
  print("Bigger than 2")
  print("Still bigger")
print("Done with 2")

for i in range(5) :
  print(i)
  if i > 2 :
    print("Bigger than 2")
  print("Done with i", i)
print("All done")

# Output
# Bigger than 2
# Still bigger
# Done with 2
# 0
# Done with i 0
# 1
# Done with i 1
# 2
# Done with i 2
# 3
# Bigger than 2
# Done with i 3
# 4
# Bigger than 2
# Done with i 4
# All done
```

<br>

#### Nested Decisions
Nested decisions are composed of nested command blocks. A parameter is queried with `if` followed by a second query in the same block. The second query does not work if the `if` result in the first block is false.

```python
x = 42
if x > 1 :
  print("More than one")        # Output : More than one
  if x < 100 :
    print("Less than 100")      # Output : Less than 100
print("All done")               # Output : All done
```

# Two-Way Decisions
## else : alternative execution
In a one-way decision, the program responds to something either yes or no and acts accordingly. The decision has only one answer, and the only condition set for this response is executed. For example, you go to the grocery store and ask "do you have menthol flavored gum?" If the answer is yes, you buy it and finish the task. If the answer is no, then the conditioned part becomes invalid, and the program continues where it left off, so actually there is no "no" option. But in a two-way decision, there are two option to execute. If the answer is yes, buy it but if the answer is no not buy go to the next option, buy a watermelon flavored. A decision has separate code streams for both yes and no and in the end only one of the given options works.

The if statement is alternative execution, in which there are two possibilities and the condition determines which one gets executed. But sometimes we want to do one thing if a logical expression is true and something else if the expression is false. It is like a fork in the road. We must choose one or the other path but not both. For this, we use the `if`  together with the `else`.


```python
x = 4
if x > 2 :
  print("Bigger")           # Output : Bigger
else :
  print("Smaller")          # Output : Smaller (Not execute for this example)
print("All done")           # Output : All done
```

# Multi-Way Decisions
## elif : chained conditionals
Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. There is no limit on the number of elif statements. If there is an else clause, it has to be at the end, but there doesn't have to be one. Each condition is checked in order. If the first is false, the next is checked, and so on. If one of them is true, the corresponding branch executes, and the statement ends. Even if more than one condition is true, only the first true branch executes. Note that only one statement is true in multi-way decisions and it will executed.


```python
if x < 2 :
  print("small")
elif x < 10 :
  print("Medium")
else :
  print("LARGE")
print("All done")
```

<br>
Below you see the logical schema of this code.

![mif0ag.png](http://i65.tinypic.com/mif0ag.png)

Also, a multi-way code can be written in which there is no `else` at all. In this case, if both of the conditions given by if and elif are false, they continue to the other lines of the code without running anything. Else is a block of code that is written to be valid when none of the conditions are always present.

<br>

```python
# No else
x = 5
if x < 2 :
  print("Small")      # Output : Small (not execute for this example)
elif x < 10 :
  print("Medium")     # Output : Medium
print("All done")     # Output : All done
```

A code with multiple `elif` commands can be written in it.

```python
if x < 2 :
  print("Small")
elif x < 10 :
  print("Medium")
elif x < 20 :
  print("Big")
elif x < 40 :
  print("Large")
elif x < 100 :
  print("Huge")
else :
  print("Ginormous")
```

In the following example, one line in each code will never work.
The first one is the `else` part of the code block 1. Because whatever value you give to x will be less than 2 or greater than or equal to 2, the program will never run into either the or part of the `elif`.

On the code block 2, the `x <10` block never works because of the `x <10` and `x <10` rankings are problematic regarding logic. Because x is less than 10 means that it is already less than 20, the program finishes the process and does not go to the next command.

```python
# These both code block has one line will never print
# Code block 1
if x < 2 :
  print("Below 2")
elif x >= 2 :
  print("Two or more")
else :
  print("Something else")       # will never print

# Code block 2
if x < 2 :
  print("Below 2")
elif x < 20 :
  print("Below 20")
elif x < 10 :
  print("Below 10")             # will never print
else :
  print("Something else")
```


## try / except

You surround a dangerous section of code with **try** and **except**
If the code in the **try** works - the **except** is skipped
It the code in **try** fails - it jumps to the **except** section

Python does not execute code below when it encounters a problem such as the following. This is especially common when the user enters data. To overcome this, a structure called try / except can be use.

```python
astr = "Hello Bob"
istr = int(astr)
print("First", istr)
astr = "123"
istr = int(istr)
print("Second", istr)
# Output : Traceback (most recent call last): File "notry.py", line 2, in <module> istr = int(astr) ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: "Hello Bob"
```

In the above example, the variable astr is defined as `Hello Bob`. The program is told to try to digitize it with the int command, and if it cannot digitize it, it requests the `-1` 'value defined by the command as istr. In this sense, try and except actually works like if and else. If you try something and failure, just use that. If it succeeds in the try part, the except part doesn't work anyway, so it's not a problem.

**That's the try / except logic :**
* When the first conversion fails - it just drops into the except: clause and the program continues.
* When the second conversion succeeds - it just skips the except: clause and the program continues.

```python
astr = "Hello Bob"
try :
  istr = int(astr)
except :
  istr = -1
print("First", istr)        # Output : First -1

astr = "123"
try :
  istr = int(astr)
except :
  istr = -1
print("Second", istr)      # Output : Second 123

```

However, some problems may be in using try/except. Because it does not give an error message, and in some cases it can cause problems. As in the example below, it will explode in istr and end without running `print("There")`. So you have to be careful when using.

```python
astr = "Bob"
try :
  print("Hello")
  istr = int(astr)
  print("There")
except :
  istr = -1
print("Done", istr)
```

Below you see the logical schema of this code.

<br>

```python
# Sample try / except code
rawstr = input("Enter a number:")
try :
  ival = int(rawstr)
except :
  ival = -1

if ival > 0 :
  print("Nice work")
else :
  print("Not a number")
```
When we run the above code at the terminal, we get this result:

```
$ python3 trynum.py
Enter a number: 42
Nice work

$ python3 trynum.py
Enter a number: forty-two
Not a number
```
