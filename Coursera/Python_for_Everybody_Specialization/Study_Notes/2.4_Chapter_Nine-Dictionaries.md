# 2.4 Chapter Nine - Dictionaries

## Dictionaries
Dictionaries are the second data structures and kind of collections. The other one is list. A dictionary is like a list, but more general. In a list, the index positions have to be integers; in a dictionary, the indices can be (almost) any type.

* List is a linear collection of values that say in order.
* Dictionary is a "bag" of values, each with its own label.

Inside of a dictionary everthing has to have a label.

* Dictionaries are Python's most powerful data collection
* Dictionaries allow us to do fast database-like operations in Python
* Dictionaries have different names in different languages
	1. Associative Arrays - Perl / PHP
	2. Properties or Map or HashMap - Java
	3. Property Bag - C# / .Net


```python
purse = dict()
purse["money"] = 12
purse["candy"] = 3
purse["tissues"] = 75
print(purse)
# Output
# {'money': 12, 'candy': 3, 'tissues': 75}

print(purse["candy"])
# 3

purse["candy"] = purse["candy"] + 2
print(purse)
# {'money': 12, 'candy': 5, 'tissues': 75}
```
***Comparing Lists and Dictionaries***

Lists index their entries based on the position in the list. Dictinaries are like bags with no orders. Dictionaries are like lists except that they use keys instead of numbers to loouk up values. So we index the things we put in the dictionary with a "lookup tag".

```python
# List
lst = list()
lst.append(21)
lst.append(183)
print(lst)							# Output : [21, 183]
lst[0] = 23
print(lst)							# Output : [23, 183]

# Dictionary
ddd = dict()
ddd["age"] = 21
ddd["course"] = 182
print(ddd)							# Output : {'age': 21, 'course': 182}
ddd["age"] = 23
print(ddd)							# Output : {'age': 23, 'course': 182}
```


The `len` function works on dictionaries; it returns the number of key-value pairs.

```python
eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}
print(len(eng2sp))
# Output : 3
```

The `in` operator works on dictionaries; it tells you whether something appears as a key in the dictionary (appearing as a value is not good enough).

The `in` operator uses different algorithms for lists and dictionaries. For lists, it uses a linear search algorithm. As the list gets longer, the search time gets longer in direct proportion to the length of the list. For dictionaries, Python uses an algorithm called a hash table that has a remarkable property: the in operator takes about the same amount of time no matter how many items there are in a dictionary.

```python
eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}
print('one' in eng2sp)
# Output : True
```

To see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you can use the method `values`, which returns the values as a list, and then use the `in` operator.

```python
eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}
vals = list(eng2sp.values())
print('uno' in vals)
# Output : True
```

## Dictionary Literals (Constants)
The function `dict` creates a new dictionary with no items. Because `dict` is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name. Dictionary literals use curly braces and have a list of `key : value` pairs. The curly brackets, `{}`, represent an empty dictionary. To add items to the dictionary, you can use square brackets.  Also you can make an empty dictionary using empty curly braces.

```python
jjj = {"chuck" : 1, "fred" : 42, "jan" : 100}
print(jjj)
# Output : {'chuck': 1, 'fred': 42, 'jan': 100}

ooo = {}
print(ooo)
# Output : {}
```

## Many Counters with a Dictionary
One common use of dictionaries is counting how often we "see" something.

```python
ccc = dict()
ccc["csev"] = 1
ccc["cwen"] = 1
print(ccc)
# Output : {'csev': 1, 'cwen': 1}

ccc["cwen"] = ccc["cwen"] + 1
print(ccc)
# Output : {'csev': 1, 'cwen': 2}
```


## Dictionary Tracebacks
It is an error to referance a key which is not in the dictionary.

We can use the `in` operator to see if a key is in the dictionary.

```python
ccc = dict()
print(ccc["csev"])
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: "csev"
```

## When We See a New Name
When we encounter a new name, we need to add a new entry in the dictionary and if this the second or later time we have seen the name, we simply add one to the count in the dictionary under that name.


```python
counts = dict()
names = ["csev", "cwen", "csev", "zqian", "cwen"]
for name in names :
	if name not in counts:
		counts[name] = 1
	else:
		counts[name] = counts[name] + 1
print(counts)
# Output : {'csev': 2, 'cwen': 2, 'zqian': 1}
```

## The get Method for Dictionaries
Dictionaries have a method called `get` that takes a key and a default value. The pattern of checking to see if a key is already in a dictionary and assuming a default value if the key is not there is so common that there is a method called `get()` that does this for you.
Default value if key does not excist and no Tracebacks

```python
if name in counts:
	x = counts[name]
else :
	x = 0

x = counts.get(name, 0)
```


We can use `get()` and provide a default value of zero when the key is not yet in the dictionary - and then just add one.

```python
counts = dict()
names = ["csev", "cwen", "csev", "zqian", "cwen"]
for name in names :
	counts[name] = counts.get(name, 0) + 1
print(counts)
# Output : {'csev': 2, 'cwen': 2, 'zqian': 1}
```

## Counting Pattern
One of the common uses of a dictionary is to count the occurrence of words in a file with some written text. The general pattern to count the words in a line of text is to **split** the line into words, then loop through the words and use a ditionary to track the count of each word independently.

```python
counts = dict()
print("Enter a line of text:")
line = input("")
# Input : Even healthy narcissism can sometimes fall into dysfunctional narcissistic behavior. The key is that most people who take the rare narcissistic behavior to an extreme realize they have done so. In most cases, they also feel some regret and recognize the error made. People with healthy narcissism seek to repair relationships when they have inadvertently hurt others.

words = line.split()
print("Words:", words)
# Output : Words: ['Even', 'healthy', 'narcissism', 'can', 'sometimes', 'fall', 'into', 'dysfunctional', 'narcissistic', 'behavior.', 'The', 'key', 'is', 'that', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'take', 'the', 'rare', 'narcissistic', 'behavior', 'to', 'an', 'extreme', 'realize', 'they', 'have', 'done', 'so.', 'In', 'most', 'cases,', 'they', 'also', 'feel', 'some', 'regret', 'and', 'recognize', 'the', 'error', 'made.', 'People', 'with', 'healthy', 'narcissism', 'seek', 'to', 'repair', 'relationships', 'when', 'they', 'have', 'inadvertently', 'hurt', 'others.']

print("Counting...")
for word in words:
	counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1
print("Counts", counts)
# Output : Counts {'Even': 1, 'healthy': 2, 'narcissism': 2, 'can': 1, 'sometimes': 1, 'fall': 1, 'into': 1, 'dysfunctional': 1, 'narcissistic': 2, 'behavior.': 1, 'The': 1, 'key': 1, 'is': 1, 'that': 1, 'most': 2, 'people': 1, 'who': 1, 'take': 1, 'the': 2, 'rare': 1, 'behavior': 1, 'to': 2, 'an': 1, 'extreme': 1, 'realize': 1, 'they': 3, 'have': 2, 'done': 1, 'so.': 1, 'In': 1, 'cases,': 1, 'also': 1, 'feel': 1, 'some': 1, 'regret': 1, 'and': 1, 'recognize': 1, 'error': 1, 'made.': 1, 'People': 1, 'with': 1, 'seek': 1, 'repair': 1, 'relationships': 1, 'when': 1, 'inadvertently': 1, 'hurt': 1, 'others.': 1}
```

## Definite Loops and Dictionaries
Even though dictionaries are not stored in order, we can look up the keys and values. If you use a dictionary as the sequence in a `for` statement, it traverses the keys of the dictionary. This loop prints each key and the corresponding value.


```python
counts = {"chuck" : 1, "fred" : 42, "jan" : 100}
for key in counts :
	print(key, counts[key])
# Output :
# chuck 1
# fred 42
# jan 100
```

We can use this pattern to implement the various loop idioms.

```python
counts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}
for key in counts:
    if counts[key] > 10 :
        print(key, counts[key])
# Output :
# annie 42
# jan 100
```


## Retrieving lists of Keys and Values
You can get a list of keys, values or items(both) from a dictionary.

```python
jjj = {"chuck" : 1, "fred" : 42, "jan" : 100}
print(list(jjj))
# Output : ['chuck', 'fred', 'jan']

print(jjj.keys())
# Output : dict_keys(['chuck', 'fred', 'jan'])

print(jjj.values())
# Output : dict_values([1, 42, 100])

print(jjj.items())
# Output : dict_items([('chuck', 1), ('fred', 42), ('jan', 100)])
```

If you want to print the keys in alphabetical order, you first make a list of the `keys` in the dictionary using the keys method available in dictionary objects, and then sort that list and loop through the sorted list, looking up each key and printing out key-value pairs in sorted order as follows.

```python
counts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}
lst = list(counts.keys())
print(lst)
lst.sort()
for key in lst:
    print(key, counts[key])
# Output :
# annie 42
# chuck 1
# jan 100
```

## Two Iteration Variables
We loop through the ley-value pairs in a dictionary usint "two" iteration variables

Each iteration the first variable is the key and the second variable is the corresponding value for the key

```python
jjj = {"chuck" : 1, "fred" : 42, "jan" : 100}
for aaa, bbb in jjj.items():
	print(aaa,bbb)
# Output :
# chuck 1
# fred 42
# jan 100
```


```python
name = input("Enter file:")
handle = open(name)

counts = dict()
for line in handle:
	words = line.split()
	for word in words:
		counts[word] = counts.get(word,0) + 1

bigcount = None
bigword = None
for word,count in counts.items():
	if bigcount is None or count > bigcount:
		bigword = word
		bigcount = count

print(bigword, bigcount)

# Input - Output
# words.txt - to 16
# clown.txt - the 7
```
