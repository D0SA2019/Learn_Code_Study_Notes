# 4.1 Chapter 14 - Object Oriented Python

##  Unicode Characters and Strings
Computers doesn't understand the letters, what computers understand is numbers. So we had to come up with mapping between letters and numbers. There are few mappings.

### ASCII : American Standart Code for Information Interchange

![](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/1/2/1/ascii_table_black.png)

In the 1960s and 1970s, we just assumed that one byte was one character.

Each character is represented by a number between 0 and 256 stored in 8 bits of memory.

We refer to "8 bits of memors as a 'byte' of memory - (i.e. my disk drive contains 3 Terabytes of memory)"

The `ord()` function tells us the numeric value of a simple ASCII character

```python
print(ord('H'))
print(ord('e'))
print(ord('\n'))


# Output :
72
101
10
```


### Unicode : Universal Code
To represent the wide range of characters computers must handle we represent characters with more than one byte.

* UTF-16 : Fixed lenght - Two bytes
* UTF-32 : Fixed lenght - Four bytes
* UTF-8 : I-4 bytes
	* Upwards compatible with ASCII
	* Automatic detection between ASCII and UTF-8
	* UTF-8 is recommended practice for encoding data to be exchanged between systems

#### Python 3 and Unicode

In Python 3, all strings internally are UNICODE

Working with string variables in Python programs and reading data from files usually "just works"

When we talk to a network resource using sockets or talk to a database we have to encode and decode data (usually to UTF-8)

#### Python Strings to Bytes
When we an external resource like a network socket we sends bytes, so we need to encode Python 3 strings into a given character encoding

When we read data from an external resource, we must decode it based on the character set so it is properly represented in Python 3 as a string

```python
while True :
	data = mysock.recv(512)
	if (len(data) < 1) :
		break
	mystring = data.decode()
	print(mystring)
```


#### An HTTP Request in Python

```python
import socket

mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))
cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd)

while True:
	data = mysock.recv(512)
	if (len(data) < 1) :
		break
	print(data.decode())
mysock.close()
```

Output :

```

## Object Oriented Definitions and Terminology
As programs get to be millions of lines long, it becomes increasingly important to write code that is easy to understand. If you are working on a million-line program, you can never keep the entire program in your mind at the same time. We need ways to break large programs into multiple smaller pieces so that we have less to look at when solving a problem, fix a bug, or add a new feature.

In a way, object oriented programming is a way to arrange your code so that you can zoom into 50 lines of the code and understand it while ignoring the other 999,950 lines of code for the moment.

Instead of being the "whole program" - each object is a little "island" within the program and cooperatively working with other objects. A program is made up of one or more objects working together - objects make use of each other's capabilities

#### Object?

An object is a bit of self-contained code and data

A key aspect of the Object approach is to break the problem into smaller understandable parts (divide and conquer)

Objects have boundaries that allow us to ignore un-needed detail

We have been using objects all along : String Objects, Integer Objects, Dictionary Objects, List Objects ...

![](http://i67.tinypic.com/2lau90n.png)

Python provides us with many built-in objects. Here is some simple code where the first few lines should feel very simple and natural to you.

```python
stuff = list()
stuff.append('python')
stuff.append('chuck')
stuff.sort()
print (stuff[0])
print (stuff.__getitem__(0))
print (list.__getitem__(stuff,0))
```

#### Definitions

**Class** : A shape, template.

**Method or Message** : A defined capability of a class

**Field or attribute** : A bit of data in a class

**Object or Instance** : A particular instance of a class



----

#### Terminology

**Class** : Defines the abstract characteristic of a thing (object), including the thing's characteristics (its atrributes, fields or properties) and the thing's behaviors (the things it can do, or methods, operations or features). One migh say that a class is a blueprint or factory that describes the nature of something. For example, the class Dog would consist of traits shared by all dogs, such as breed and fur color (characteristics), and the ability to bark and sit (behaviors).

**Instance** : One can have an instance of a class or a particular object. The instance is the actual object created at runtime. In programmer jargon, the Lassie object is an instance of the Dog class. The set of values of the attributes of a particular object is called its state. The object consist of state and the behavior that's defined in the object's class.

**Method** : An object's abilities. In language, methods are verbs. Lassie, being a Dog, has the ability to bark. So `bark()` is one of Lassie's methods.


#### Some Python Objects

```python
x = "abc"
print(type(x))
# Output : <class 'str'>

print(type(2.5))
# Output : <class 'float'>

print(type(2))
# Output : <class 'int'>

y = list()
print(type(y))
# Output : <class 'list'>

z = dict()
print(type(z))
# Output : <class 'dict'>

print(dir(x))
# Output : ['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__getnewargs__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'capitalize', 'casefold', 'center', 'count', 'encode', 'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', 'format_map', 'index', 'isalnum', 'isalpha', 'isascii', 'isdecimal', 'isdigit', 'isidentifier', 'islower', 'isnumeric', 'isprintable', 'isspace', 'istitle', 'isupper', 'join', 'ljust', 'lower', 'lstrip', 'maketrans', 'partition', 'replace', 'rfind', 'rindex', 'rjust', 'rpartition', 'rsplit', 'rstrip', 'split', 'splitlines', 'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']

```


## Our First Class and Object

At a basic level, an object is simply some code plus data structures that are smaller than a whole program. Defining a function allows us to store a bit of code and give it a name and then later invoke that code using the name of the function.

An object can contain a number of functions (which we call methods) as well as data that is used by those functions. We call data items that are part of the object attributes.

We use the `class` keyword to define the data and code that will make up each of the objects. The class keyword includes the name of the class and begins an indented block of code where we include the attributes (data) and methods (code).

```python
class PartyAnimal:
	x = 0

	def party(self):
		self.x = self.x + 1
		print("So far", self.x)

an = PartyAnimal()

an.party()
an.party()
an.party()
```

**Output :**

```
So far 1
So far 2
So far 3
```

Each method looks like a function, starting with the `def` keyword and consisting of an indented block of code. This object has one attribute `(x)` and one method `(party)`. The methods have a special first parameter that we name by convention self.

Just as the `def` keyword does not cause function code to be executed, the `class` keyword does not create an object. Instead, the `class` keyword defines a template indicating what data and code will be contained in each object of type `PartyAnimal`. The class is like a cookie cutter and the objects created using the class are the cookies2. You don't put frosting on the cookie cutter; you put frosting on the cookies, and you can put different frosting on each cookie.

If we continue through this sample program, we see the first executable line of code:

```python
an = PartyAnimal()
```

This is where we instruct Python to construct (i.e., create) an object or instance of the class `PartyAnimal`. It looks like a function call to the class itself. Python constructs the object with the right data and methods and returns the object which is then assigned to the variable `an`. In a way this is quite similar to the following line which we have been using all along:

```python
counts = dict()
```

Here we instruct Python to construct an object using the `dict` template (already present in Python), return the instance of dictionary, and assign it to the variable `counts`.

When the `PartyAnimal` class is used to construct an object, the variable `an` is used to point to that object. We use `an` to access the code and data for that particular instance of the `PartyAnimal` class.

Each Partyanimal object/instance contains within it a variable `x` and a method/function named `party`. We call the `party` method in this line:

```python
an.party()
```

When the `party` method is called, the first parameter (which we call by convention `self`) points to the particular instance of the `PartyAnimal` object that `party` is called from. Within the `party` method, we see the line:

```python
self.x = self.x + 1
```

This syntax using the dot operator is saying 'the x within self.' Each time `party()` is called, the internal `x` value is incremented by 1 and the value is printed out.

The following line is another way to call the `party` method within the an object:

```python
PartyAnimal.party(an)
```

In this variation, we access the code from within the class and explicitly pass the object pointer `an` as the first parameter (i.e., self within the method). You can think of `an.party()` as shorthand for the above line.

When the program executes, it produces the following output:

```
So far 1
So far 2
So far 3
```

#### Playing with `dir()` and `type()`

We can take a look at the capabilities of an object by looking at the output of the `dir()` function.  Below the list, ignore the ones with underscores - these are used by Python itself. The rest are real operations that the object can perform. It is like `type()` - it tells us something "about" a variable.

```python
y = list()
print(type(y))
# Output : <class 'list'>

print(dir(y))
# Output : ['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__imul__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__reversed__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']
```

We can use the built-in `dir` function to examine the capabilities of a variable. We can also use `type` and `dir` with the classes that we create.

```python
class PartyAnimal:
	x = 0

	def party(self):
		self.x = self.x + 1
		print("So far", self.x)

an = PartyAnimal()

print("Type", type(an))
# Output : Type <class '__main__.PartyAnimal'>

print("Dir", dir(an))
# Output : Dir [... 'party', 'x']
```

You can see that using the `class` keyword, we have created a new type. From the `dir` output, you can see both the `x` integer attribute and the `party` method are available in the object.

## Object Life Cycle
Objects are created, used and discarded. Usually, we don't think much about the creation and destruction of variables, but often as our objects become more complex, we need to take some action within the object to set things up as the object is constructed and possibly clean things up as the object is discarded.

We have special blocks of code (methods) that get called
* At the moment creation (constructor)
* At the moment of destruction (destructor)

Constructors are used a lot

Destructors are seldom used

**Constructor** : The primary purpose of the constructor is to set up some instance variables to have the proper initial values when the object created.

The constructor and destructor are optional. The constructor is typically used to set up variables. The destructor is seldom used.

```python
class PartyAnimals:
	x = 0

	def __init__(self):
		print("I am constructed")

	def parties(self):
		self.x = self.x + 1
		print("So far", self.x)

	def __del__(self) :
		print("I am destructed", self.x)

ann = PartyAnimals()
ann.parties()
ann.parties()

ann = 42
print("ann contains", ann)
```

**Output :**

```
I am constructed
So far 1
So far 2
I am destructed 2
ann contains 42
```

In object oriented programming, a constructor in a class is a special block of statmenets called when an object is created.

#### Many Instances
We can create lots of objects - the class is the template for the object

We can store each distinct object in its own variable

We call this having multiple instances of the same class

Each instance has its own copy of the instance variables

Constructors can have additional parameters. These can be used to sey up instance variables for the particular instance of the class (i.e. for the particular object)

```python
class PartyAnimale:
	x = 0
	name =""

	def __init__(self, z):
		self.name = z
		print(self.name, "constructed")

	def partyy(self):
		self.x = self.x + 1
		print(self.name, "party count", self.x)

s = PartyAnimale("Sally")
s.partyy()

j = PartyAnimale("Jim")
j.partyy()
s.partyy()
```

**Output :**

```
Sally constructed
Sally party count 1
Jim constructed
Jim party count 1
Sally party count 2
```


## Object Inheritance

When we make a new class - we can reuse an existing class and inherit all the capabilities of an existing class and then add our own little bit to make our new class.

Another form of store and reuse

Write once - reuse many times

The new class (child) has all the capabilities of the old class (parent) - and then some more

#### Terminology

**Inheritance** : "Subclasses" are more specialized versions of a class, which inherit attributes and behaviors from their parent classes, and can introduce their own.

In the below example, `FootballFan` is a class which extends `Party_Animal`. It has all the capabilities of `Party_Animal` and more.

```python
class Party_Animal:
	x = 0
	name = ""

	def __init__(self, nam):
		self.name = nam
		print(self.name, "constructed")

	def partyyy(self):
		self.x = self.x + 1
		print(self.name, "party count", self.x)

class FootballFan(Party_Animal):
	points = 0

	def touchdown(self):
		self.points = self.points + 7
		self.partyyy()
		print(self.name, "points", self.points)

r = Party_Animal("Sally")
r.partyyy()

k = FootballFan("Jim")
k.partyyy()
k.touchdown()
```

**Output :**

```
Sally constructed
Sally party count 1
Jim constructed
Jim party count 1
Jim party count 2
Jim points 7
```
