# 2.5 Chapter Nine - Tuples

A tuple is a sequence of values much like a list. The values stored in a tuple can be any type, and they are indexed by integers. The important difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples are also comparable and hashable so we can sort lists of them and use tuples as key values in Python dictionaries.

Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values

```python
t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
```

To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include the final comma.

```python
t1 = ('a',)
```

Another way to construct a tuple is the built-in function `tuple`. With no argument, it creates an empty tuple.

```python
t = tuple()
```
Most list operators also work on tuples. The bracket operator indexes an element.

```python
t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
print(t[0])
# Output : a
```

If the argument is a sequence (string, list, or tuple), the result of the call to tuple is a tuple with the elements of the sequence.

```python
t = tuple('lupins')
print(t)
# Output :
# ('l', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's')
```

Below, you can see the tuples as x. It exactly looks like lists except we use parentheses and x has three tuple. Tuples comes from mathematics so a two-tuple is a thing that has two things.

```python
x = ("Glenn", "Sally", "Joseph")
print(x[2])
# Output : Joseph

y = (1, 9, 2)
print(y)
# Output : (1, 9, 2)

print(max(y))
# Output : 9

for iter in y:
	print(iter)
# Output
# 1
# 9
# 2
```

**Differences from lists**

Tuples are not changeable, they immutable. Unlike a list, once you create a tuple, you cannot alter its contents - smilar to a string. Lists have to allocate extra memory that to let them be changed.

```python
x = [9, 8, 7]
x[2] = 6
print(x)
# Output : [9, 8, 6]

y = "ABC"
y[2] = "D"
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#  File "coursera_c2_chapter10.py", line 2, in <module>
#    y[2] = "D"
#TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

z = (5, 4, 3)
z[2] = 0
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#  File "coursera_c2_chapter10.py", line 2, in <module>
#    z[2] = 0
#TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

Things not to do with tuples :
* `x.sort()`
* `x.append()`
* `x.reverse()`

```python
l = list()
dir(l)
# Output :
# ['append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']

t = tuple()
dir(t)
# Output :
# ['count', 'index']
```
You can use `count` and `index` with tuples. `count` looks up how many things match a particular value, `index` says where is a particular value.

**Tuples Are More Efficient**

Since Python does not have to build tuple structures to be modifiable, they are simpler and more efficient in terms of memory use and performance than lists.

So in our program when we are making "temporary variables" we prefer tuples over lists.


## Tuples and Assignment

We can also put a tuple on the left-hand side of an assignment statment. We can even omit the parentheses. This allows you to assign more than one variable at a time when the left side is a sequence.

```python
(x, y) = (4, "fred")
print(y)
# Output : fred

(a, b) = (99, 98)
print(a)
# Output : 99
```

## Tuples and Dictionaries
The `items()` method in dictionaries returns a list of (key, value) tuples. As you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in no particular order.

```python
d = dict()
d["csev"] = 2
d["cwen"] = 4
for (k,v) in d.items():
	print(k,v)
# Output :
# csev 2
# cwen 4

tups = d.items()
print(tups)
# Output
# dict_items([('csev', 2), ('cwen', 4)])
```

## Tuples are Comparable
The comparison operators work with tuples and other sequences.  Python starts by comparing the first element from each sequence. If they are equal, it goes on to the next element, and so on, until it finds elements that differ. Subsequent elements are not considered (even if they are really big).

```Python
print((0, 1, 2) < (5, 1, 2))
# Output : True
print((0, 1, 2000000) < (0, 3, 4))
# Output : True
print(("Jones", "Sally") < ("Jones", "Sam"))
# Output : True
print(("Jones", "Sally") < ("Adams", "Sam"))
# Output : False
```


## Sorting Lists of Tuples
We can take advantage of the ability to sort a list of tuples to get a sorted version of a dictionary.

First we sort the dictionary by the key using the `items()` method and `sorted()` function. It sorts primarily by first element, but in the case of a tie, it sorts by second element, and so on.

```python
d = {"a":10, "b":1, "c":22}
print(d.items())
# Output:
# dict_items([('a', 10), ('b', 1), ('c', 22)])

print(sorted(d.items()))
# Output :
# [('a', 10), ('b', 1), ('c', 22)]
```
`sort` compares the first element, length, first, and only considers the second element to break ties. The keyword argument `reverse=True` tells `sort` to go in decreasing order.

## Using `sorted()`
We can do this even more directly using the built-in function sorted that takes a sequence as a parameter and returns a sorted sequance.

```python
d = {"a":10, "b":1, "c":22}
t = sorted(d.items())
print(t)
# Output :
# [('a', 10), ('b', 1), ('c', 22)]

for k,v in sorted(d.items()):
	print(k,v)
# Output :
# a 10
# b 1
# c 22
```


## Sort by Values Instead of Key
If we could construct a list of tuples of the form (value,key) we could sort by value.

We do this with a `for` loop that creates a list of tuples.

```python
c = {"a":10, "b":1, "c":22}
tmp = list()
for k,v in c.items():
	tmp.append((v,k))

print(tmp)
# Output :
# [(10, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (22, 'c')]

tmp = sorted(tmp, reverse=True)
print(tmp)
# [(22, 'c'), (10, 'a'), (1, 'b')]
```


### The top 10 most common words in a text

```python
fhand = open("romeo.txt")
counts = dict()

for line in fhand:
	words = line.split()
	for word in words:
		counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1

lst = list()
for key, val in counts.items():
	newtup = (val, key)
	lst.append(newtup)

lst = sorted(lst, reverse=True)

for val, key in lst[:10]:
	print(key, val)

# Output :
# the 3
# is 3
# and 3
# sun 2
# yonder 1
# with 1
# window 1
# what 1
# through 1
# soft 1
```

**Even Shorter Version**
List comprehension creates a dynamic list. In this case, we make a list of reversed tuples and then sort it.

```python
c = {"a":10, "b":1, "c":22}
print(sorted([(v,k) for k,v in c.items()]))
# Output :
# [(1, 'b'), (10, 'a'), (22, 'c')]
```
