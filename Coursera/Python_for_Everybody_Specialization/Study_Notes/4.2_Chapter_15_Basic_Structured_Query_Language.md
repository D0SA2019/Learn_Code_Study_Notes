# 4.2 Chapter 15 - Basic Structured Query Language

## Relational Databases

While this chapter will focus on using Python to work with data in SQLite database files, many operations can be done more conveniently using software called the Database Browser for SQLite which is freely available from: https://sqlitebrowser.org/

---

A database is a file that is organized for storing data. Most databases are organized like a dictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so it persists after the program ends. Because a database is stored on permanent storage, it can store far more data than a dictionary, which is limited to the size of the memory in the computer.

Like a dictionary, database software is designed to keep the inserting and accessing of data very fast, even for large amounts of data. Database software maintains its performance by building indexes as data is added to the database to allow the computer to jump quickly to a particular entry.

Relational databases model data by storing rows and columns in tables. The power of relational database lies in its ability to efficiently retrieve data from those tables and in particular where there are multiple tables and the relationships between those tables involved in the query.

When you first look at a database it looks like a spreadsheet with multiple sheets. The primary data structures in a database are: tables, rows, and columns.

#### Terminology

**Database** - contains many tables

**Relation (or table)** - contains tuples and attributes

**Tuple (or row)** - a set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a person or a music track

**Attribute (also column or fiels)** - one of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row

#### SQL

**Structured Query Languages** is the language we use to issue commands to the databases.

* Create a table
* Retrieve some data
* Insert data
* Update data
* Delete data


## Using Databases

#### Two Roles in Large Projects

**Application Developer** - Builds the logic for the application, the look and feel of the application - monitors the application for problems

**Database Administrator** - Monitors and adjusts the database as the program runs in production

Often both people participate in the building of the "Data model"

#### Database Model

A database model or database schema is the structure or format of a database, described in a formal language supported by the database management system. In other words, a database model is the application of a data model when used in conjunction with a database management system.


#### Common Database Systems

Three major database management systems in wide use
* **Oracle** - Large, commercial, enterprise-scale, very very tweakable
* **MySQL** - Simpler but very fast and scalable - commercial open source
* **SqlServer** - Very nice - from Microsoft (also Access)

Many other smaller projects, free and open source
* HSQL, SQLite, Postgress


## Creating and Building Database by Python

Databases require more defined structure than Python lists or dictionaries1.

When we create a database table we must tell the database in advance the names of each of the columns in the table and the type of data which we are planning to store in each column. When the database software knows the type of data in each column, it can choose the most efficient way to store and look up the data based on the type of data.

Defining structure for your data up front may seem inconvenient at the beginning, but the payoff is fast access to your data even when the database contains a large amount of data.

The code to create a database file and a table named Tracks with two columns in the database is as follows:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('music.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Tracks')
cur.execute('CREATE TABLE Tracks (title TEXT, plays INTEGER)')

conn.close()
```

The `connect` operation makes a "connection" to the database stored in the file `music.sqlite3` in the current directory. If the file does not exist, it will be created. The reason this is called a "connection" is that sometimes the database is stored on a separate "database server" from the server on which we are running our application. In our simple examples the database will just be a local file in the same directory as the Python code we are running.

A cursor is like a file handle that we can use to perform operations on the data stored in the database. Calling `cursor()` is very similar conceptually to calling `open()` when dealing with text files.

![](http://i66.tinypic.com/2a5yn42.png)

Once we have the cursor, we can begin to execute commands on the contents of the database using the `execute()` method.

Database commands are expressed in a special language that has been standardized across many different database vendors to allow us to learn a single database language. The database language is called Structured Query Language or SQL for short.

In our example, we are executing two SQL commands in our database. As a convention, we will show the SQL keywords in uppercase and the parts of the command that we are adding (such as the table and column names) will be shown in lowercase.

The first SQL command removes the `Tracks` table from the database if it exists. This pattern is simply to allow us to run the same program to create the `Tracks` table over and over again without causing an error. Note that the `DROP TABLE` command deletes the table and all of its contents from the database (i.e., there is no "undo").

`cur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Tracks ')`

The second command creates a table named `Tracks` with a text column named `title` and an integer column named plays.

`cur.execute('CREATE TABLE Tracks (title TEXT, plays INTEGER)')`


Now that we have created a table named `Tracks`, we can put some data into that table using the SQL `INSERT` operation. Again, we begin by making a connection to the database and obtaining the `cursor`. We can then execute SQL commands using the cursor.

The SQL `INSERT` command indicates which table we are using and then defines a new row by listing the fields we want to include `(title, plays)` followed by the `VALUES` we want placed in the new row. We specify the values as question marks `(?, ?)` to indicate that the actual values are passed in as a tuple `( 'My Way', 15 )` as the second parameter to the `execute()` call.

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('music.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('INSERT INTO Tracks (title, plays) VALUES (?, ?)',
    ('Thunderstruck', 20))
cur.execute('INSERT INTO Tracks (title, plays) VALUES (?, ?)',
    ('My Way', 15))
conn.commit()

print('Tracks:')
cur.execute('SELECT title, plays FROM Tracks')
for row in cur:
     print(row)

cur.execute('DELETE FROM Tracks WHERE plays < 100')
conn.commit()

cur.close()
```

First we `INSERT` two rows into our table and use `commit()` to force the data to be written to the database file.

![](http://i64.tinypic.com/moq6v.png)

Then we use the `SELECT` command to retrieve the rows we just inserted from the table. On the `SELECT` command, we indicate which columns we would like `(title, plays)` and indicate which table we want to retrieve the data from. After we execute the `SELECT` statement, the cursor is something we can loop through in a `for` statement. For efficiency, the cursor does not read all of the data from the database when we execute the `SELECT` statement. Instead, the data is read on demand as we loop through the rows in the `for` statement.

The output of the program is as follows:

```
Tracks:
('Thunderstruck', 20)
('My Way', 15)
```

Our `for` loop finds two rows, and each row is a Python tuple with the first value as the `title` and the second value as the number of `plays`.

Note: You may see strings starting with `u'` in other books or on the Internet. This was an indication in Python 2 that the strings are Unicode* strings that are capable of storing non-Latin character sets. In Python 3, all strings are unicode strings by default.*

At the very end of the program, we execute an SQL command to `DELETE` the rows we have just created so we can run the program over and over. The `DELETE` command shows the use of a `WHERE` clause that allows us to express a selection criterion so that we can ask the database to apply the command to only the rows that match the criterion. In this example the criterion happens to apply to all the rows so we empty the table out so we can run the program repeatedly. After the `DELETE` is performed, we also call `commit()` to force the data to be removed from the database.


## Creating and Building Database by SQLite

We can also create a new database on SQLite menu instead of Python.

![](http://i63.tinypic.com/2d7xbnb.png)


#### Start Simple - A Single Table

Write these codes on **Execute SQL** window. The `128` is the lenght of the variable, it's up to 128 characters.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE Users (
	name VARCHAR(128),
	email VARCHAR(128)
)
```
And then play the Execute button on the top list, the table are ready now.

![](http://i66.tinypic.com/vimeef.png)


We can add data on **Browse Data** --> **New Record** section

![](http://i63.tinypic.com/13yq7oo.png)

If we look at the **SQL Log** tab we see this :

![](http://i64.tinypic.com/2v155ih.png)


#### SQL Insert

The Insert statement inserts a row into a table

Type the code on Execute SQL tab and click the play button

```
INSERT INTO Users(name,email) VALUES('Kristin','kf@umich.edu')
```

![](http://i68.tinypic.com/2vljj28.png)

Now we have new data on our table

![](http://i68.tinypic.com/30i8f1f.png)


#### SQL Delete

Deletes a row in a table based on a selection criteria

```
DELETE FROM Users WHERE email='fred@umich.edu'
```

![](http://i66.tinypic.com/wa1vki.png)


#### SQL Update
Allows the updating of a field with a where clause

```
UPDATE Users SET name='Charles' WHERE email='csev@umich.edu'
```

![](http://i64.tinypic.com/1z378jm.png)


#### Retrieving Records : `SELECT`
The select statement retrieves a group of records - you can either retrieve all the records or a subset of the records with a `WHERE` clause

```
SELECT*FROM Users
```

![](http://i68.tinypic.com/hsooef.png)

```
SELECT*FROM Users WHERE email='csev@umich.edu'
```

![](http://i64.tinypic.com/2ai0hmr.png)


#### Sorting with `ORDER BY`
You can add an `ORDER BY` clause to `SELECT` statements to get the results sorted in ascending or descending order

```
SELECT*FROM Users ORDER BY email
```

![](http://i67.tinypic.com/spyog8.png)


```
SELECT*FROM Users ORDER BY name
```

![](http://i68.tinypic.com/bi1g12.png)


#### SQL Summary

So far, we have been using the Structured Query Language in our Python examples and have covered many of the basics of the SQL commands. In this section, we look at the SQL language in particular and give an overview of SQL syntax.

Since there are so many different database vendors, the Structured Query Language (SQL) was standardized so we could communicate in a portable manner to database systems from multiple vendors.

A relational database is made up of tables, rows, and columns. The columns generally have a type such as text, numeric, or date data. When we create a table, we indicate the names and types of the columns:

```
CREATE TABLE Tracks (title TEXT, plays INTEGER)
```

To insert a row into a table, we use the SQL `INSERT` command:

```
INSERT INTO Tracks (title, plays) VALUES ('My Way', 15)
```

The `INSERT` statement specifies the table name, then a list of the fields/columns that you would like to set in the new row, and then the keyword `VALUES` and a list of corresponding values for each of the fields.

The SQL `SELECT` command is used to retrieve rows and columns from a database. The `SELECT` statement lets you specify which columns you would like to retrieve as well as a `WHERE` clause to select which rows you would like to see. It also allows an optional `ORDER BY` clause to control the sorting of the returned rows.

```
SELECT * FROM Tracks WHERE title = 'My Way'
```

Using `*` indicates that you want the database to return all of the columns for each row that matches the `WHERE` clause.

Note, unlike in Python, in a SQL `WHERE` clause we use a single equal sign to indicate a test for equality rather than a double equal sign. Other logical operations allowed in a `WHERE` clause include `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, as well as `AND` and `OR` and parentheses to build your logical expressions.

You can request that the returned rows be sorted by one of the fields as follows:

```
SELECT title,plays FROM Tracks ORDER BY title
```

To remove a row, you need a `WHERE` clause on an SQL `DELETE` statement. The `WHERE` clause determines which rows are to be deleted:

```
DELETE FROM Tracks WHERE title = 'My Way'
```

It is possible to `UPDATE` a column or columns within one or more rows in a table using the SQL `UPDATE` statement as follows:

```
UPDATE Tracks SET plays = 16 WHERE title = 'My Way'
```

The `UPDATE` statement specifies a table and then a list of fields and values to change after the `SET` keyword and then an optional `WHERE` clause to select the rows that are to be updated. A single `UPDATE` statement will change all of the rows that match the `WHERE` clause. If a `WHERE` clause is not specified, it performs the `UPDATE` on all of the rows in the table.

These four basic SQL commands (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE) allow the four basic operations needed to create and maintain data.


## Worked Example: Counting Email in a Database


```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('emaildb.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Counts')

cur.execute('''
CREATE TABLE Counts (email TEXT, count INTEGER)''')

fname = input('Enter file name: ')
if (len(fname) < 1): fname = 'mbox-short.txt'
fh = open(fname)
for line in fh:
    if not line.startswith('From: '): continue
    pieces = line.split()
    email = pieces[1]
    cur.execute('SELECT count FROM Counts WHERE email = ? ', (email,))
    row = cur.fetchone()
    if row is None:
        cur.execute('''INSERT INTO Counts (email, count)
                VALUES (?, 1)''', (email,))
    else:
        cur.execute('UPDATE Counts SET count = count + 1 WHERE email = ?',
                    (email,))
    conn.commit()

# https://www.sqlite.org/lang_select.html
sqlstr = 'SELECT email, count FROM Counts ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10'

for row in cur.execute(sqlstr):
    print(str(row[0]), row[1])

cur.close()
```


**Output** :

```
Enter file name: mbox-short.txt

## Worked Example: Twspider.py (Chapter 15)

In this section, we will create a simple spidering program that will go through Twitter accounts and build a database of them. Note: Be very careful when running this program. You do not want to pull too much data or run the program for too long and end up having your Twitter access shut off.

One of the problems of any kind of spidering program is that it needs to be able to be stopped and restarted many times and you do not want to lose the data that you have retrieved so far. You don't want to always restart your data retrieval at the very beginning so we want to store data as we retrieve it so our program can start back up and pick up where it left off.

We will start by retrieving one person's Twitter friends and their statuses, looping through the list of friends, and adding each of the friends to a database to be retrieved in the future. After we process one person's Twitter friends, we check in our database and retrieve one of the friends of the friend. We do this over and over, picking an "unvisited" person, retrieving their friend list, and adding friends we have not seen to our list for a future visit.

We also track how many times we have seen a particular friend in the database to get some sense of their "popularity".

By storing our list of known accounts and whether we have retrieved the account or not, and how popular the account is in a database on the disk of the computer, we can stop and restart our program as many times as we like.

This program is a bit complex. It is based on the code from the exercise earlier in the book that uses the Twitter API.

Here is the source code for our Twitter spidering application:

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import urllib.error
import twurl
import json
import sqlite3
import ssl

TWITTER_URL = 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends/list.json'

conn = sqlite3.connect('spider.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Twitter
            (name TEXT, retrieved INTEGER, friends INTEGER)''')

# Ignore SSL certificate errors
ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.check_hostname = False
ctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

while True:
    acct = input('Enter a Twitter account, or quit: ')
    if (acct == 'quit'): break
    if (len(acct) < 1):
        cur.execute('SELECT name FROM Twitter WHERE retrieved = 0 LIMIT 1')
        try:
            acct = cur.fetchone()[0]
        except:
            print('No unretrieved Twitter accounts found')
            continue

    url = twurl.augment(TWITTER_URL, {'screen_name': acct, 'count': '5'})
    print('Retrieving', url)
    connection = urlopen(url, context=ctx)
    data = connection.read().decode()
    headers = dict(connection.getheaders())

    print('Remaining', headers['x-rate-limit-remaining'])
    js = json.loads(data)
    # Debugging
    # print json.dumps(js, indent=4)

    cur.execute('UPDATE Twitter SET retrieved=1 WHERE name = ?', (acct, ))

    countnew = 0
    countold = 0
    for u in js['users']:
        friend = u['screen_name']
        print(friend)
        cur.execute('SELECT friends FROM Twitter WHERE name = ? LIMIT 1',
                    (friend, ))
        try:
            count = cur.fetchone()[0]
            cur.execute('UPDATE Twitter SET friends = ? WHERE name = ?',
                        (count+1, friend))
            countold = countold + 1
        except:
            cur.execute('''INSERT INTO Twitter (name, retrieved, friends)
                        VALUES (?, 0, 1)''', (friend, ))
            countnew = countnew + 1
    print('New accounts=', countnew, ' revisited=', countold)
    conn.commit()

cur.close()
```

Our database is stored in the file `spider.sqlite3` and it has one table named `Twitter`. Each row in the `Twitter` table has a column for the account name, whether we have retrieved the friends of this account, and how many times this account has been "friended".

In the main loop of the program, we prompt the user for a Twitter account name or "quit" to exit the program. If the user enters a Twitter account, we retrieve the list of friends and statuses for that user and add each friend to the database if not already in the database. If the friend is already in the list, we add 1 to the `friends` field in the row in the database.

If the user presses enter, we look in the database for the next Twitter account that we have not yet retrieved, retrieve the friends and statuses for that account, add them to the database or update them, and increase their `friends` count.

Once we retrieve the list of friends and statuses, we loop through all of the `user` items in the returned JSON and retrieve the `screen_name` for each user. Then we use the `SELECT` statement to see if we already have stored this particular `screen_name` in the database and retrieve the friend count (`friends`) if the record exists.

```python
countnew = 0
countold = 0
for u in js['users'] :
    friend = u['screen_name']
    print(friend)
    cur.execute('SELECT friends FROM Twitter WHERE name = ? LIMIT 1',
        (friend, ) )
    try:
        count = cur.fetchone()[0]
        cur.execute('UPDATE Twitter SET friends = ? WHERE name = ?',
            (count+1, friend) )
        countold = countold + 1
    except:
        cur.execute('''INSERT INTO Twitter (name, retrieved, friends)
            VALUES ( ?, 0, 1 )''', ( friend, ) )
        countnew = countnew + 1
print('New accounts=',countnew,' revisited=',countold)
conn.commit()
```

Once the cursor executes the `SELECT` statement, we must retrieve the rows. We could do this with a `for` statement, but since we are only retrieving one row (`LIMIT 1`), we can use the `fetchone()` method to fetch the first (and only) row that is the result of the `SELECT` operation. Since `fetchone()` returns the row as a tuple (even though there is only one field), we take the first value from the tuple using to get the current friend count into the variable `count`.

If this retrieval is successful, we use the SQL `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to add 1 to the `friends` column for the row that matches the friend's account. Notice that there are two placeholders (i.e., question marks) in the SQL, and the second parameter to the `execute()` is a two-element tuple that holds the values to be substituted into the SQL in place of the question marks.

If the code in the `try` block fails, it is probably because no record matched the `WHERE name = ?` clause on the `SELECT` statement. So in the `except` block, we use the SQL `INSERT` statement to add the friend's `screen_name` to the table with an indication that we have not yet retrieved the `screen_name` and set the friend count to zero.

So the first time the program runs and we enter a Twitter account, the program runs as follows:

```
Enter a Twitter account, or quit: drchuck
Retrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...
New accounts= 20  revisited= 0
Enter a Twitter account, or quit: quit
```

Since this is the first time we have run the program, the database is empty and we create the database in the file `spider.sqlite3` and add a table named `Twitter` to the database. Then we retrieve some friends and add them all to the database since the database is empty.

At this point, we might want to write a simple database dumper to take a look at what is in our `spider.sqlite3` file:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('spider.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute('SELECT * FROM Twitter')
count = 0
for row in cur:
    print(row)
    count = count + 1
print(count, 'rows.')
cur.close()
```

This program simply opens the database and selects all of the columns of all of the rows in the table `Twitter`, then loops through the rows and prints out each row.

If we run this program after the first execution of our Twitter spider above, its output will be as follows:

```
('opencontent', 0, 1)
('lhawthorn', 0, 1)
('steve_coppin', 0, 1)
('davidkocher', 0, 1)
('hrheingold', 0, 1)
...
20 rows.
```

We see one row for each `screen_name`, that we have not retrieved the data for that `screen_name`, and everyone in the database has one friend.

Now our database reflects the retrieval of the friends of our first Twitter account (drchuck). We can run the program again and tell it to retrieve the friends of the next "unprocessed" account by simply pressing enter instead of a Twitter account as follows:

```
Enter a Twitter account, or quit:
Retrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...
New accounts= 18  revisited= 2
Enter a Twitter account, or quit:
Retrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...
New accounts= 17  revisited= 3
Enter a Twitter account, or quit: quit
```

Since we pressed enter (i.e., we did not specify a Twitter account), the following code is executed:

```python
if ( len(acct) < 1 ) :
    cur.execute('SELECT name FROM Twitter WHERE retrieved = 0 LIMIT 1')
    try:
        acct = cur.fetchone()[0]
    except:
        print('No unretrieved twitter accounts found')
        continue
```

We use the SQL `SELECT` statement to retrieve the name of the first (`LIMIT 1`) user who still has their "have we retrieved this user" value set to zero. We also use the `fetchone()[0]` pattern within a try/except block to either extract a `screen_name` from the retrieved data or put out an error message and loop back up.

If we successfully retrieved an unprocessed `screen_name`, we retrieve their data as follows:

```python
url=twurl.augment(TWITTER_URL,{'screen_name': acct,'count': '20'})
print('Retrieving', url)
connection = urllib.urlopen(url)
data = connection.read()
js = json.loads(data)

cur.execute('UPDATE Twitter SET retrieved=1 WHERE name = ?',(acct, ))
```

Once we retrieve the data successfully, we use the `UPDATE` statement to set the `retrieved` column to 1 to indicate that we have completed the retrieval of the friends of this account. This keeps us from retrieving the same data over and over and keeps us progressing forward through the network of Twitter friends.

If we run the friend program and press enter twice to retrieve the next unvisited friend's friends, then run the dumping program, it will give us the following output:

```
('opencontent', 1, 1)
('lhawthorn', 1, 1)
('steve_coppin', 0, 1)
('davidkocher', 0, 1)
('hrheingold', 0, 1)
...
('cnxorg', 0, 2)
('knoop', 0, 1)
('kthanos', 0, 2)
('LectureTools', 0, 1)
...
55 rows.
```

We can see that we have properly recorded that we have visited `lhawthorn` and `opencontent`. Also the accounts `cnxorg` and `kthanos` already have two followers. Since we now have retrieved the friends of three people (`drchuck`, `opencontent`, and `lhawthorn`) our table has 55 rows of friends to retrieve.

Each time we run the program and press enter it will pick the next unvisited account (e.g., the next account will be `steve_coppin`), retrieve their friends, mark them as retrieved, and for each of the friends of `steve_coppin` either add them to the end of the database or update their friend count if they are already in the database.

Since the program's data is all stored on disk in a database, the spidering activity can be suspended and resumed as many times as you like with no loss of data.


## Designing a Data Model
The real power of a relational database is when we create multiple tables and make links between those tables. The act of deciding how to break up your application data into multiple tables and establishing the relationships between the tables is called data modeling. The design document that shows the tables and their relationships is called a data model.

Data modeling is a relatively sophisticated skill and we will only introduce the most basic concepts of relational data modeling in this section.


Database design is an art form of its own with particular skills and experience. Our goal is to avoid the really bad mistakes and design clean and easily understood databases. Others may performance tune things later.

Database design starts with a picture


![](http://i63.tinypic.com/23wwcn5.png)

#### Three kinds of keys

Now that we have started building a data model putting our data into multiple linked tables and linking the rows in those tables using keys, we need to look at some terminology around keys. There are generally three kinds of keys used in a database model.

* A ***logical key*** is a key that the "real world" might use to look up a row. In our example data model, the name field is a logical key. It is the screen name for the user and we indeed look up a user's row several times in the program using the `name` field. You will often find that it makes sense to add a `UNIQUE` constraint to a logical key. Since the logical key is how we look up a row from the outside world, it makes little sense to allow multiple rows with the same value in the table.

* A ***primary key*** is usually a number that is assigned automatically by the database. It generally has no meaning outside the program and is only used to link rows from different tables together. When we want to look up a row in a table, usually searching for the row using the primary key is the fastest way to find the row. Since primary keys are integer numbers, they take up very little storage and can be compared or sorted very quickly. In our data model, the `id` field is an example of a primary key.

* A ***foreign key*** is usually a number that points to the primary key of an associated row in a different table. An example of a foreign key in our data model is the `from_id`.

We are using a naming convention of always calling the primary key field name `id` and appending the suffix `_id` to any field name that is a foreign key.


#### Building a Data Model
Drawing a picture of the data objects for our application and then figuring out how to represent the objects and their relationships

Basic Rule : Don't put the same string data in twice - use a relationship instead

When there is one thing in the "real world" there should be one copy of that thing in the database


## Representing a Data Model in Tables

![](http://i63.tinypic.com/3484vuf.png)

We're going to create a new table on our database called "Artist". The table will have two column "id" and "name". The "id" column will have these check "NOT NULL", "PRIMARY KEY" and "AUTOINCREAMENT".

![](http://i68.tinypic.com/6xu6nb.png)

Second table that we're going to create is "Genre" table for our music program :

```
CREATE TABLE Genre(
	id			INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
	name 		TEXT
)
```

![](http://i65.tinypic.com/4ik4t1.png)

![](http://i68.tinypic.com/nox72r.png)


Second tables that we're going to create are "Album" and "Track" tables for our music program :

```
CREATE TABLE Album(
	id						INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
	artist_id 		INTEGER,
	title					TEXT
)

CREATE TABLE Track(
	id						INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
	title					TEXT,
	album_id			INTEGER,
	genre_id			INTEGER,
	len 					INTEGER,
	rating 				INTEGER,
	count 				INTEGER
)
```

## Inserting Relational Data

```
INSERT INTO Artist (name) VALUES ('Led Zeplin')
INSERT INTO Artist (name) VALUES ('AC/DC')
```

![](http://i63.tinypic.com/11hghso.png)


```
INSERT INTO Genre (name) VALUES ('Rock') ;
INSERT INTO Genre (name) VALUES ('Metal')
```

![](http://i66.tinypic.com/2s1vpqs.png)


```
INSERT INTO Album (title, artist_id) VALUES ('Who Made Who', 2) ;
INSERT INTO Album (title, artist_id) VALUES ('IV', 1)
```

![](http://i66.tinypic.com/2s1vpqs.png)


```
INSERT INTO Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) VALUES ('Black Dog', 5, 297, 0, 2, 1) ;
INSERT INTO Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) VALUES ('Stairway', 5, 482, 0, 2, 1) ;
INSERT INTO Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) VALUES ('About to Rock', 5, 313, 0, 1, 2) ;
INSERT INTO Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) VALUES ('Who Made Who', 5, 207, 0, 1, 2)
```

## Reconstructing Data with JOIN

#### Relational Power
By removing the replicated data and replacing it with references to a single copy of each bit of data we build a "web" of information that the relational database can read through very quickly - even for very large amounts of data

Often when you want some data it comes from a number of tables linked by these foreign keys


#### The JOIN Operation
The `JOIN` operation links across several tables as part of a select operation. You must tell the `JOIN` how to use the keys that make the connection between the tables using an `ON` clause

![](http://i68.tinypic.com/2z5swow.png)

```
SELECT Album.title, Artist.name FROM Album JOIN Artist ON Album.artist_id=Artist.id
```

![](http://i67.tinypic.com/r8dukj.png)

![](http://i66.tinypic.com/2m5f211.png)

```
SELECT Album.title, Album.artist_id, Artist.id, Artist.name FROM Album JOIN Artist ON Album.artist_id=Artist.id
```

![](http://i66.tinypic.com/2ymefxy.png)


![](http://i63.tinypic.com/2lj6nfr.png)

```
SELECT Track.title, Genre.name FROM Track JOIN Genre ON Track.genre_id=Genre.id
```

![](http://i66.tinypic.com/33tle36.png)


Joining two tables without an `ON` clause gives all possible combinations of rows

```
SELECT Track.title, Genre.name FROM Track JOIN Genre
```

![](http://i64.tinypic.com/2iu268w.png)


![](http://i65.tinypic.com/2u5xtmv.png)


```
SELECT Track.title, Artist.name, Album.title, Genre.name FROM Track JOIN Genre JOIN Album JOIN Artist ON Track.genre_id=Genre.id AND Track.album_id=Album.id AND Album.artist_id=Artist.id
```

## Worked Example: Tracks.py (Chapter 15)

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('trackdb.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

# Make some fresh tables using executescript()
cur.executescript('''
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Artist;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Album;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Track;

CREATE TABLE Artist (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    name    TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Album (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    artist_id  INTEGER,
    title   TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Track (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
        AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    title TEXT  UNIQUE,
    album_id  INTEGER,
    len INTEGER, rating INTEGER, count INTEGER
);
''')


fname = input('Enter file name: ')
if ( len(fname) < 1 ) : fname = 'Library.xml'

# <key>Track ID</key><integer>369</integer>
# <key>Name</key><string>Another One Bites The Dust</string>
# <key>Artist</key><string>Queen</string>
def lookup(d, key):
    found = False
    for child in d:
        if found : return child.text
        if child.tag == 'key' and child.text == key :
            found = True
    return None

stuff = ET.parse(fname)
all = stuff.findall('dict/dict/dict')
print('Dict count:', len(all))
for entry in all:
    if ( lookup(entry, 'Track ID') is None ) : continue

    name = lookup(entry, 'Name')
    artist = lookup(entry, 'Artist')
    album = lookup(entry, 'Album')
    count = lookup(entry, 'Play Count')
    rating = lookup(entry, 'Rating')
    length = lookup(entry, 'Total Time')

    if name is None or artist is None or album is None :
        continue

    print(name, artist, album, count, rating, length)

    cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Artist (name)
        VALUES ( ? )''', ( artist, ) )
    cur.execute('SELECT id FROM Artist WHERE name = ? ', (artist, ))
    artist_id = cur.fetchone()[0]

    cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Album (title, artist_id)
        VALUES ( ?, ? )''', ( album, artist_id ) )
    cur.execute('SELECT id FROM Album WHERE title = ? ', (album, ))
    album_id = cur.fetchone()[0]

    cur.execute('''INSERT OR REPLACE INTO Track
        (title, album_id, len, rating, count)
        VALUES ( ?, ?, ?, ?, ? )''',
        ( name, album_id, length, rating, count ) )

    conn.commit()
```

## Many-to-Many Relationships in SQL

Sometimes we need to model a relationship that is many-to-many

We need to add a "connection" table with two foreign keys

There is usually no separate primary key

#### Start with a Fresh Database

```
CREATE TABLE User (
		id				INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
		name			TEXT,
		emaildb		TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
		id				INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
		title			TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Member (
		user_id		INTEGER,
		course_id	INTEGER,
		role 			INTEGER,
		PRIMARY KEY (user_id, course_id)
)
```

![](http://i68.tinypic.com/21dopol.png)

```
INSERT INTO User (name, email) VALUES ('Jane', 'jane@tsugi.org');
INSERT INTO User (name, email) VALUES ('Ed', 'ed@tsugi.org');
INSERT INTO User (name, email) VALUES ('Sue', 'sue@tsugi.org');

INSERT INTO Course (title) VALUES ('Python');
INSERT INTO Course (title) VALUES ('SQL');
INSERT INTO Course (title) VALUES ('PHP');
```

![](http://i63.tinypic.com/5voo6a.png)


```
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (1, 1, 1);
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (2, 1, 0);
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (3, 1, 0);

INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (1, 2, 0);

## Worked Example: roster.py (Chapter 15)

```python
import json
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('rosterdb.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

# Do some setup
cur.executescript('''
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS User;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Member;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Course;

CREATE TABLE User (
    id     INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    name   TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
    id     INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    title  TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Member (
    user_id     INTEGER,
    course_id   INTEGER,
    role        INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, course_id)
)
''')

fname = input('Enter file name: ')
if len(fname) < 1:
    fname = 'roster_data_sample.json'

# [
#   [ "Charley", "si110", 1 ],
#   [ "Mea", "si110", 0 ],

str_data = open(fname).read()
json_data = json.loads(str_data)

for entry in json_data:

    name = entry[0];
    title = entry[1];

    print((name, title))

    cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO User (name)
        VALUES ( ? )''', ( name, ) )
    cur.execute('SELECT id FROM User WHERE name = ? ', (name, ))
    user_id = cur.fetchone()[0]

    cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Course (title)
        VALUES ( ? )''', ( title, ) )
    cur.execute('SELECT id FROM Course WHERE title = ? ', (title, ))
    course_id = cur.fetchone()[0]

    cur.execute('''INSERT OR REPLACE INTO Member
        (user_id, course_id) VALUES ( ?, ? )''',
        ( user_id, course_id ) )

    conn.commit()
```

**Output** :

```
Enter file name: roster_data_sample.json
('Charley', 'si110')
('Mea', 'si110')
('Hattie', 'si110')
('Lyena', 'si110')
('Keziah', 'si110')
('Ellyce', 'si110')
...
('Mutinta', 'si430')
('Manwen', 'si430')
```
